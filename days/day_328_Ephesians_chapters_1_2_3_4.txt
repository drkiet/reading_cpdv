Day 328:

Reading Ephesians, chapters ['1', '2', '3', '4']:

  Chapter 1.

    1: Paul, an Apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God, to all the saints who are at Ephesus and to the faithful in Christ Jesus
    2: Grace and peace to you from God the Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ
    3: Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavens, in Christ
    4: just as he chose us in him before the foundation of the world, so that we would be holy and immaculate in his sight, in charity
    5: He has predestined us to adoption as sons, through Jesus Christ, in himself, according to the purpose of his will
    6: for the praise of the glory of his grace, with which he has gifted us in his beloved Son
    7: In him, we have redemption through his blood: the remission of sins in accord with the riches of his grace
    8: which is superabundant in us, with all wisdom and prudence
    9: So does he make known to us the mystery of his will, which he has set forth in Christ, in a manner well-pleasing to him,
    10: in the dispensation of the fullness of time, so as to renew in Christ everything that exists through him in heaven and on earth
    11: In him, we too are called to our portion, having been predestined in accord with the plan of the One who accomplishes all things by the counsel of his will
    12: So may we be, to the praise of his glory, we who have hoped beforehand in Christ
    13: In him, you also, after you heard and believed the Word of truth, which is the Gospel of your salvation, were sealed with the Holy Spirit of the Promise
    14: He is the pledge of our inheritance, unto the acquisition of redemption, to the praise of his glory
    15: Because of this, and hearing of your faith that is in the Lord Jesus, and of your love toward all the saints
    16: I have not ceased giving thanks for you, calling you to mind in my prayers
    17: so that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give a spirit of wisdom and of revelation to you, in knowledge of him
    18: May the eyes of your heart be illuminated, so that you may know what is the hope of his calling, and the wealth of the glory of his inheritance with the saints
    19: and the preeminent magnitude of his virtue toward us, toward we who believe in accord with the work of his powerful virtue
    20: which he wrought in Christ, raising him from the dead and establishing him at his right hand in the heavens
    21: above every principality and power and virtue and dominion, and above every name that is given, not only in this age, but even in the future age
    22: And he has subjected all things under his feet, and he has made him the head over the entire Church
    23: which is his body and which is the fullness of him who accomplishes everything in everyone

  Chapter 2.

    1: And you were once dead in your sins and offenses
    2: in which you walked in times past, according to the age of this world, according to the prince of the power of this sky, the spirit who now works in the sons of distrust
    3: And we too were all conversant in these things, in times past, by the desires of our flesh, acting according to the will of the flesh and according to our own thoughts. And so we were, by nature, sons of wrath, even like the others
    4: Yet still, God, who is rich in mercy, for the sake of his exceedingly great charity with which he loved us
    5: even when we were dead in our sins, has enlivened us together in Christ, by whose grace you have been saved
    6: And he has raised us up together, and he has caused us to sit down together in the heavens, in Christ Jesus
    7: so that he may display, in the ages soon to arrive, the abundant wealth of his grace, by his goodness toward us in Christ Jesus
    8: For by grace, you have been saved through faith. And this is not of yourselves, for it is a gift of God
    9: And this is not of works, so that no one may glory
    10: For we are his handiwork, created in Christ Jesus for the good works which God has prepared and in which we should walk
    11: Because of this, be mindful that, in times past, you were Gentiles in the flesh, and that you were called uncircumcised by those who are called circumcised in the flesh, something done by man
    12: and that you were, in that time, without Christ, being foreign to the way of life of Israel, being visitors to the testament, having no hope of the promise, and being without God in this world
    13: But now, in Christ Jesus, you, who were in times past far away, have been brought near by the blood of Christ
    14: For he is our peace. He made the two into one, by dissolving the intermediate wall of separation, of opposition, by his flesh
    15: emptying the law of commandments by decree, so that he might join these two, in himself, into one new man, making peac
    16: and reconciling both to God, in one body, through the cross, destroying this opposition in himself
    17: And upon arriving, he evangelized peace to you who were far away, and peace to those who were near
    18: For by him, we both have access, in the one Spirit, to the Father
    19: Now, therefore, you are no longer visitors and new arrivals. Instead, you are citizens among the saints in the household of God
    20: having been built upon the foundation of the Apostles and of the Prophets, with Jesus Christ himself as the preeminent cornerstone
    21: In him, all that has been built is framed together, rising up into a holy temple in the Lord
    22: In him, you also have been built together into a habitation of God in the Spirit

  Chapter 3.

    1: By reason of this grace, I, Paul, am a prisoner of Jesus Christ, for the sake of you Gentiles
    2: Now certainly, you have heard of the dispensation of the grace of God, which has been given to me among you
    3: that, by means of revelation, the mystery was made known to me, just as I have written above in a few words
    4: Yet, by reading this closely, you might be able to understand my prudence in the mystery of Christ
    5: In other generations, this was unknown to the sons of men, even as it has now been revealed to his holy Apostles and Prophets in the Spirit
    6: so that the Gentiles would be co-heirs, and of the same body, and partners together, by his promise in Christ Jesus, through the Gospel
    7: Of this Gospel, I have been made a minister, according to the gift of the grace of God, which has been given to me by means of the operation of his virtue
    8: Although I am the least of all the saints, I have been given this grace: to evangelize among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ
    9: and to enlighten everyone concerning the dispensation of the mystery, hidden before the ages in God who created all things
    10: so that the manifold wisdom of God may become well-known to the principalities and powers in the heavens, through the Church
    11: according to that timeless purpose, which he has formed in Christ Jesus our Lord
    12: In him we trust, and so we approach with confidence, through his faith
    13: Because of this, I ask you not to be weakened by my tribulations on your behalf; for this is your glory
    14: By reason of this grace, I bend my knees to the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ
    15: from whom all paternity in heaven and on earth takes its name
    16: And I ask him to grant to you to be strengthened in virtue by his Spirit, in accord with the wealth of his glory, in the inner man
    17: so that Christ may live in your hearts through a faith rooted in, and founded on, charity
    18: So may you be able to embrace, with all the saints, what is the width and length and height and dept
    19: of the charity of Christ, and even be able to know that which surpasses all knowledge, so that you may be filled with all the fullness of God
    20: Now to him who is able to do all things, more abundantly than we could ever ask or understand, by means of the virtue which is at work in us
    21: to him be glory, in the Church and in Christ Jesus, throughout every generation, forever and ever. Amen

  Chapter 4.

    1: And so, as a prisoner in the Lord, I beg you to walk in a manner worthy of the vocation to which you have been called
    2: with all humility and meekness, with patience, supporting one another in charity
    3: Be anxious to preserve the unity of the Spirit within the bonds of peace
    4: One body and one Spirit: to this you have been called by the one hope of your calling
    5: one Lord, one faith, one baptism
    6: one God and Father of all, who is over all, and through all, and in us all
    7: Yet to each one of us there has been given grace according to the measure allotted by Christ
    8: Because of this, he says: “Ascending on high, he took captivity itself captive; he gave gifts to men.
    9: Now that he has ascended, what is left except for him also to descend, first to the lower parts of the earth
    10: He who descended is the same one who also ascended above all the heavens, so that he might fulfill everything
    11: And the same one granted that some would be Apostles, and some Prophets, yet truly others evangelists, and others pastors and teachers
    12: for the sake of the perfection of the saints, by the work of the ministry, in the edification of the body of Christ
    13: until we all meet in the unity of faith and in the knowledge of the Son of God, as a perfect man, in the measure of the age of the fullness of Christ
    14: So may we then no longer be little children, disturbed and carried about by every wind of doctrine, by the wickedness of men, and by the craftiness which deceives unto error
    15: Instead, acting according to truth in charity, we should increase in everything, in him who is the head, Christ himself
    16: For in him, the whole body is joined closely together, by every underlying joint, through the function allotted to each part, bringing improvement to the body, toward its edification in charity
    17: And so, I say this, and I testify in the Lord: that from now on you should walk, not as the Gentiles also walk, in the vanity of their mind
    18: having their intellect obscured, being alienated from the life of God, through the ignorance that is within them, because of the blindness of their hearts
    19: Such as these, despairing, have given themselves over to sexual immorality, carrying out every impurity with rapacity
    20: But this is not what you have learned in Christ
    21: For certainly, you have listened to him, and you have been instructed in him, according to the truth that is in Jesus
    22: to set aside your earlier behavior, the former man, who was corrupted, by means of desire, unto error
    23: and so be renewed in the spirit of your mind
    24: and so put on the new man, who, in accord with God, is created in justice and in the holiness of truth
    25: Because of this, setting aside lying, speak the truth, each one with his neighbor. For we are all part of one another
    26: “Be angry, but do not be willing to sin.” Do not let the sun set over your anger
    27: Provide no place for the devil
    28: Whoever was stealing, let him now not steal, but rather let him labor, working with his hands, doing what is good, so that he may have something to distribute to those who suffer need
    29: Let no evil words proceed from your mouth, but only what is good, toward the edification of faith, so as to bestow grace upon those who listen
    30: And do not be willing to grieve the Holy Spirit of God, in whom you have been sealed, unto the day of redemption
    31: Let all bitterness and anger and indignation and outcry and blasphemy be taken away from you, along with all malice
    32: And be kind and merciful to one another, forgiving one another, just as God has forgiven you in Christ
