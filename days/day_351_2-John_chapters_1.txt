Day 351:

Reading 2-John, chapters ['1']:

  Chapter 1.

    1: The Elder to the Elect Lady, and those born of her, whom I love in the truth: and not I alone, but also all those who have known the truth
    2: because the truth which dwells in us shall be with us for eternity
    3: May grace, mercy, and peace be with you from God the Father, and from Christ Jesus, the Son of the Father, in truth and in love
    4: I was very glad because I discovered some of your sons walking in the truth, just as we received the commandment from the Father
    5: And now I petition you, Lady, not as if writing a new commandment to you, but instead that commandment which we have had from the beginning: that we love one another
    6: And this is love: that we walk according to his commandments. For this is the commandment that you have heard in the same way from the beginning, and in which you should walk
    7: For many deceivers have gone out into the world, those who do not confess that Jesus Christ has arrived in the flesh. Such a one as this is a deceiver and an antichrist
    8: Be cautious for yourselves, lest you lose what you have accomplished, and so that, instead, you may receive a full reward
    9: Everyone who withdraws and does not remain in the doctrine of Christ, does not have God. Whoever remains in the doctrine, such a one as this has both the Father and the Son
    10: If anyone comes to you, and does not bring this doctrine, do not be willing to receive him into the house, and do not speak a greeting to him
    11: For whoever speaks a greeting to him, is speaking with his evil works
    12: I have much more to write to you, but I am not willing to do so through paper and ink. For I hope that I may be with you in the future, and that I may speak face to face, so that your joy may be full
    13: The sons of your Elect Sister greet you
