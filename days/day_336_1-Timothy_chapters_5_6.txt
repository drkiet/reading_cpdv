Day 336:

Reading 1-Timothy, chapters ['5', '6']:

  Chapter 5.

    1: You should not rebuke an old man, but rather plead with him, as if he were your father; with young men, like brothers
    2: with old women, like mothers; with young women, in all chastity, like sisters
    3: Honor those widows who are true widows
    4: But if any widow has children or grandchildren, let her first learn to manage her own household, and to fulfill, in turn, her own obligation to her parents; for this is acceptable before God
    5: But she who is truly a widow and is destitute, let her hope in God, and let her be urgent in supplications and prayers, night and day
    6: For she who is living in pleasures is dead, while living
    7: And give instruction in this, so that they may be beyond reproach
    8: But if anyone has no concern for his own, and especially for those of his own household, he has denied the faith, and he is worse than an unbeliever
    9: Let a widow be chosen who is no less than sixty years of age, who was the wife of one husband
    10: who has testimony of her good works: whether she has educated children, or has provided hospitality, or has washed the feet of the saints, or has ministered to those suffering tribulation, or has pursued any kind of good work
    11: But avoid the younger widows. For once they have flourished in Christ, they will want to marry
    12: resulting in damnation, because they have disregarded the primacy of faith
    13: And being at the same time also idle, they learn to go from house to house, being not only idle, but also talkative and curious, speaking of things which do not concern them
    14: Therefore, I want the younger women to marry, to procreate children, to be mothers of families, to provide no ready opportunity for the adversary to speak evil
    15: For certain ones have already been turned back to Satan
    16: If any among the faithful have widows, let him minister to them and not burden the Church, so that there may be enough for those who are true widows
    17: Let priests who lead well be held worthy of twice the honor, especially those who labor in the Word and in doctrine
    18: For Scripture says: “You shall not muzzle an ox as it is treading out the grain,” and, “The worker is worthy of his pay.
    19: Do not be willing to accept an accusation against a priest, except under two or three witnesses
    20: Reprove sinners in the sight of everyone, so that the others may have fear
    21: I testify before God and Christ Jesus and the elect Angels, that you should observe these things without prejudgment, doing nothing which shows favoritism to either side
    22: You should not be quick to impose hands on anyone, nor should you take part in the sins of outsiders. Keep yourself chaste
    23: Do not continue to drink only water, but make use of a little wine, for the sake of your stomach and your frequent infirmities
    24: The sins of some men have been made manifest, preceding them to judgment, but those of others are manifested later
    25: Similarly, too, good deeds have been made manifest, but even when they are not, they cannot remain hidden

  Chapter 6.

    1: Whoever are servants under the yoke, let them consider their masters to be worthy of every honor, lest the name and doctrine of the Lord be blasphemed
    2: But those who have believing masters, let them not despise them because they are brothers, but rather serve them all the more because they are believing and beloved, participants of the same service. Teach and exhort these things
    3: If anyone teaches otherwise, and does not consent to the sound words of our Lord Jesus Christ, and to that doctrine which is in accord with piety
    4: then he is arrogant, knowing nothing, yet languishing amid the questions and quarrels of words. From these arise envy, contention, blasphemy, evil suspicions
    5: the conflicts of men who have been corrupted in mind and deprived of truth, who consider profit to be piety
    6: But piety with sufficiency is great gain
    7: For we brought nothing into this world, and there is no doubt that we can take nothing away
    8: But, having nourishment and some kind of covering, we should be content with these
    9: For those who want to become rich fall into temptation and into the snare of the devil and into many useless and harmful desires, which submerge men in destruction and in perdition
    10: For desire is the root of all evils. Some persons, hungering in this way, have strayed from the faith and have entangled themselves in many sorrows
    11: But you, O man of God, flee from these things, and truly pursue justice, piety, faith, charity, patience, meekness
    12: Fight the good fight of faith. Take hold of the eternal life to which you have been called, and make a good profession of faith in the sight of many witnesses
    13: I charge you, in the sight of God, who enlivens all things, and in the sight of Christ Jesus, who gave the testimony of a good profession under Pontius Pilate
    14: to observe the commandment, immaculately, irreproachably, unto the return of our Lord Jesus Christ
    15: For at the proper time, he shall reveal the blessed and only Power, the King of kings and the Lord of lords
    16: who alone holds immortality, and who inhabits the inaccessible light, whom no man has seen, nor even is able to see, to whom is honor and everlasting dominion. Amen
    17: Instruct the wealthy of this age not to have a superior attitude, nor to hope in the uncertainty of riches, but in the living God, who offers us everything in abundance to enjoy
    18: and to do good, to become rich in good works, to donate readily, to share
    19: to gather for themselves the treasure of a good foundation for the future, so that they may obtain true life
    20: O Timothy, guard what has been deposited with you, avoiding the voice of profane novelties and of opposing ideas, which are falsely called knowledge
    21: Certain persons, promising these things, have perished from the faith. May grace be with you. Amen
