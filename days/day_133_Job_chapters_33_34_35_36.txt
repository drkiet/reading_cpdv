Day 133:

Reading Job, chapters ['33', '34', '35', '36']:

  Chapter 33.

    1: Therefore, hear my speeches, Job, and listen to all my words
    2: Behold, I have opened my mouth; let my tongue speak along with my throat
    3: My words are from my simple heart, and my lips will speak a pure judgment
    4: The Spirit of God made me, and the breath of the Almighty gave me life
    5: If you can, answer me, and oppose me to my face
    6: Behold, God has made me, just as he also has made you, and I, likewise, have been formed of the same clay
    7: So, truly, do not let my wonders terrify you, and do not let my eloquence be burdensome to you
    8: For you have spoken in my hearing, and I have heard the voice of your words, saying
    9: “I am clean and without sin; I am immaculate, and there is no iniquity in me
    10: Yet he has discovered blame in me, and so he has treated me like his enemy
    11: He has put my feet in fetters; he has kept watch over all my ways.
    12: Therefore, it is for this reason that you have not been justified. For I tell you that God is greater than man
    13: Do you contend against him because he has not responded to all of your words
    14: God speaks once, and he does not repeat the same thing a second time
    15: Through a dream in a vision of the night, when a deep sleep falls over men, and they are sleeping in their beds
    16: then, he opens the ears of men, and, educating them, he teaches discipline
    17: so that he may divert a man from the things that he is doing, and may free him from pride
    18: rescuing his soul from corruption and his life from passing away by the sword
    19: Likewise, he rebukes by sorrow in bed, and he causes all of his bones to become weak
    20: Bread becomes abominable to him in his life, and, to his soul, the meat which before he desired
    21: His body will waste away, and his bones, which had been covered, will be revealed
    22: His soul has approached corruption, and his life has drawn near to what is deadly
    23: If there were an angel speaking for him, one among thousands, to declare the fairness of the man
    24: he will have mercy on him, and he will say, “Free him, so that he will not descend to destruction. I have found a reason to be favorable to him
    25: His body is consumed by suffering. Let him return to the days of his youth.
    26: He will beg pardon from God, and he will be soothing to him; and he will look upon his face in jubilation, and he will restore his justice to man
    27: He will consider mankind, and he will say: “I have sinned and truly I have offended, yet I was not treated as I deserved.
    28: He has freed his soul from continuing into destruction, so that, in living, it may see the light
    29: Behold, all these things God works three times within each one
    30: so that he may revive their souls from corruption and enlighten them with the light of life
    31: Pay attention Job, and listen to me; and remain silent, while I speak
    32: Yet, if you have anything to say, answer me and speak, for I want you to be treated justly
    33: But if you do not have anything to say, then listen to me. Be quiet and I will teach you wisdom

  Chapter 34.

    1: After proclaiming these things, Eliu now had this to say
    2: May the wise hear my words, and may the educated listen to me
    3: For the ear examines words, and the mouth discerns foods by the taste
    4: Let us choose judgment for ourselves, and let us consider among ourselves what is best
    5: For Job has said: “I am just, yet God has subverted my judgment
    6: For, within my judgment, there is a lie: my vehement barbs are without any sin.
    7: What man is there that is like Job, who drinks up derision as if it were water
    8: who accompanies those who work iniquity, and who walks with impious men
    9: For he has said, “Man will not please God, even if he should travel with him.
    10: Therefore, prudent men, hear me: impiety is far from God, and iniquity is far from the Almighty
    11: For he will restore to man his works, and according to the ways of each, he will repay them
    12: For truly, God will not condemn in vain, nor will the Almighty repudiate judgment
    13: What other is established over the earth? Or whom has he placed over the world, which he made
    14: But, if he directs his heart towards him, he will draw his spirit and breath to himself
    15: All flesh will fail together, and man will return to ashes
    16: Therefore, if you have understanding, hear what is said, and heed the sound of my eloquence
    17: Is he that does not love judgment able to be corrected? And how can you so greatly condemn him who is just
    18: He says to the king, “You are an apostate.” He calls commanders impious
    19: He does not accept the reputation of leaders; nor does he recognize the tyrant as he contends against the poor. For all are the work of his hands
    20: They will die suddenly, and the people will be troubled in the middle of the night, but they will pass through it, and the violent will be taken away without a hand
    21: For his eyes are upon the ways of men, and he examines all of their steps
    22: There is no darkness and no shadow of death, where those who work iniquity may be hidden
    23: For it is no longer within the power of man to enter into judgment with God
    24: He will break into many innumerable pieces, and he will cause others to stand up in their place
    25: For he knows their works, and, as a result, he will bring the night, and they will be crushed
    26: Just as the impious do, he has struck them in a place where they can be seen
    27: They, as if with great diligence, have withdrawn from him, and they refused to understand all his ways
    28: so that they caused the outcry of the needy to reach him, and he heard the voice of the poor
    29: For, when he grants peace, who is there that can condemn? When he hides his face, who is there that can contemplate him, either among the nations, or among all men
    30: He causes a hypocritical man to reign because of the sins of the people
    31: Therefore, since I have been speaking about God, I will not prevent you from doing the same
    32: If I have erred, you may teach me; if I have spoken unfairly, I will add no more
    33: Does God require this of you because it is displeasing to you? For you were the first to speak, and not I. But if you know something better, speak
    34: Let men of understanding speak to me, and let a wise man listen to me
    35: But Job has been speaking foolishly, and his words contain unsound teaching
    36: My father, let Job be tested even to the end; may you not retreat from a man of iniquity
    37: For he adds blasphemy on top of his sins; nevertheless, let him be constrained to be among us, and then let him provoke God to judgment with his speeches

  Chapter 35.

    1: After this, Eliu again spoke in this way
    2: Does it seem right to you in your thoughts, that you should say, “I am more just than God?
    3: For you said, “Having done what is right does not please you,” and, “How will it benefit you, if I sin?
    4: And so, I will respond to your words, and to your friends who are with you
    5: Look up towards heaven and consider; also, think about the sky, which is higher than you
    6: If you sin, how will it hurt him? And if your iniquities are multiplied, what will you do against him
    7: Furthermore, if you act justly, what will you give him, or what will he receive from your hand
    8: Your impiety may hurt a man who is like you, though your justice may help the son of the man
    9: Because of the multitude of false accusers, they will cry out; and they will lament because of the strong arm of the tyrants
    10: Yet he has not said: “Where is God, who made me, who has given songs in the night
    11: who teaches us in addition to the beasts of the earth, and who educates us along with the birds of the air?
    12: There they will cry, and he will not heed them, because of the arrogance of the wicked
    13: Therefore, God does not hear in vain, and the Almighty will look into each and every case
    14: And so, when you say, “He does not examine,” be judged before him, but wait for him
    15: For, at the present time, he does not bring forth his fury, nor does he punish sin exceedingly
    16: Therefore, Job has opened his mouth in vain and has multiplied words without knowledge

  Chapter 36.

    1: Continuing in a similar manner, Eliu had this to say
    2: Bear with me for a little while and I will show you; for I have still more to say in favor of God
    3: I will review my knowledge from the beginning, and I will prove my Maker to be just
    4: For truly my words are without any falsehood and perfect knowledge will be proven to you
    5: God does not abandon the powerful, for he himself is also powerful
    6: But he does not save the impious, though he grants judgment to the poor
    7: He will not take his eyes away from the just, and he continually establishes kings on their throne, and they are exalted
    8: And, if they are in captivity, or are bound with the chains of poverty
    9: he will reveal to them their works, as well as their sinfulness, in that they were violent
    10: Likewise, he will open their ears to his correction, and he will speak to them, so that they may return from iniquity
    11: If they listen and obey, they will fill their days with goodness and complete their years in glory
    12: But if they will not listen, they will pass away by the sword and will be consumed by foolishness
    13: The false and the crafty provoke the wrath of God, yet they do not cry out to him when they are chained
    14: Their soul will die in a storm, and their life, among the unmanly
    15: He will rescue the poor from his anguish, and he will open his ear during tribulation
    16: Therefore, he will save you from the narrow mouth very widely, even though it has no foundation under it. Moreover, your respite at table will be full of fatness
    17: Your case has been judged like that of the impious; you will withdraw your plea and your judgment
    18: Therefore, do not let anger overwhelm you so that you oppress another; neither should you allow a multitude of gifts to influence you
    19: Lay down your greatness without distress, and put aside all of your power with courage
    20: Do not prolong the night, even if people rise on their behalf
    21: Be careful that you do not turn to iniquity; for, after your misery, you have begun to follow this
    22: Behold, God is exalted in his strength, and there is no one like him among the law-givers
    23: Who is able to investigate his ways? And who can say, “You have done iniquity,” to him
    24: Remember that you are ignorant of his work, yet men have sung its praises
    25: All men consider him; and each one ponders from a distance
    26: Behold, God is great, defeating our knowledge; the number of his years is inestimable
    27: He carries away the drops of rain, and he sends forth showers like a raging whirlpool
    28: they flow from the clouds that are woven above everything
    29: If he wills it, he extends the clouds as his ten
    30: and shines with his light from above; likewise, he covers the oceans within his tent
    31: For he judges the people by these things, and he gives food to a multitude of mortals
    32: Within his hands, he hides the light, and he commands it to come forth again
    33: He announces it to his friend, for it is his possession and he is able to reach out to it
