Day 42:

Reading Deuteronomy, chapters ['9', '10', '11', '12']:

  Chapter 9.

    1: “Listen, O Israel: You shall cross over the Jordan today, in order to possess nations, very great and stronger than yourself, cities vast and walled even to the sky
    2: a people great and lofty, the sons of the Anakim, whom you yourselves have seen and heard, against whom no one is able to stand
    3: Therefore, you shall know today that the Lord your God himself will pass over before you, like a devouring and consuming fire, to crush and to wipe away and to utterly ruin them before your face, quickly, just as he has spoken to you
    4: You should not say in your heart, when the Lord your God will have destroyed them in your sight: ‘It is because of my justice that the Lord led me in, so that I might possess this land, while these nations have been destroyed because of their impiety.
    5: For it is not because of your justices or the uprightness of your heart that you will enter, so that you may possess their lands. Instead, it is because they have acted wickedly that they are destroyed upon your arrival, and so that the Lord may accomplish his word, which he promised under oath to your fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob
    6: Therefore, know that the Lord your God will not give you this excellent land as a possession due to your justices, for you are a very stiff-necked people
    7: Remember, and never forget, how you provoked the Lord your God to anger in the wilderness. You have always contended against the Lord, from the day that you went forth from Egypt, even to this place
    8: For at Horeb also, you provoked him, and, becoming angry, he was willing to destroy you
    9: when I ascended onto the mountain, so that I might receive the tablets of stone, the tablets of the covenant which the Lord formed with you. And I persevered on the mountain for forty days and nights, neither eating bread, nor drinking water
    10: And the Lord gave me two tablets of stone, written with the finger of God and containing all the words that he spoke to you on the mountain from the midst of fire, while the people, being stirred up, were assembled together
    11: And when forty days, and as many nights, had passed, the Lord gave me the two tablets of stone, the tablets of the covenant
    12: And he said to me: ‘Rise up, and descend quickly from here. For your people, whom you led away from Egypt, have quickly abandoned the way that you have shown to them, and they have made a molten idol for themselves.
    13: And again, the Lord said to me: ‘I discern that this people is stiff-necked
    14: Depart from me, so that I may crush them, and abolish their name from under heaven, and appoint you over a nation, which will be greater and stronger than this one.
    15: And as I was descending from the burning mountain, and I held the two tablets of the covenant with both hands
    16: and I had seen that you had sinned against the Lord your God, and had made a molten calf for yourselves, and had quickly abandoned his way, which he had revealed to you
    17: I threw down the tablets from my hands, and I broke them in your sight
    18: And I fell prostrate before the Lord, just as before, for forty days and nights, not eating bread, and not drinking water, because of all your sins, which you had committed against the Lord, and because you provoked him to anger
    19: For I feared his indignation and wrath, which had been stirred up against you, so that he was willing to destroy you. And the Lord heeded me at this time also
    20: Likewise, he became vehemently angry against Aaron, and he was willing to destroy him, and I prayed for him similarly
    21: But as for your sin which you committed, that is, the calf, taking hold of it, I burned it with fire. And breaking it into pieces, and reducing it entirely to dust, I threw it into the torrent that descends from the mountain
    22: Likewise, at the Burning, and at the Temptation, and at the Graves of Lust, you provoked the Lord
    23: And when he sent you from Kadesh-barnea, saying, ‘Ascend and possess the land, which I have given to you,’ even so, you spurned the command of the Lord your God, and you did not believe him, nor were you willing to listen to his voice
    24: Instead, you were ever rebellious, from the day when I first began to know you
    25: And so, I lay prostrate before the Lord for forty days and nights, as I humbly begged him, lest he destroy you, just as he had threatened to do
    26: And praying, I said: ‘O Lord God, do not destroy your people and your inheritance, whom you have redeemed in your greatness, whom you have led away from Egypt with a strong hand
    27: Remember your servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Do not look upon the stubbornness of this people, nor upon their wickedness and sinfulness
    28: Otherwise, perhaps the inhabitants of the land, out of which you have led us, may say: “The Lord was not able to lead them into the land, which he promised to them. And he hated them; therefore, he led them out, so that he might put them to death in the wilderness.
    29: These are your people and your inheritance, whom you have led out by your great strength, and with your outstretched arm.’ 

  Chapter 10.

    1: “At that time, the Lord said to me: ‘Hew for yourself two tablets of stone, like those that were before, and ascend to me on the mountain. And you shall make an ark of wood
    2: And I will write on the tablets the words which were on those that you broke before, and you shall place them in the ark.
    3: And so, I made an ark of setim wood. And when I had hewn two tablets of stone like the former, I ascended onto the mountain, having them in my hands
    4: And he wrote on the tablets, according to that which he had written before, the ten words, which the Lord spoke to you on the mountain from the midst of fire, when the people were assembled. And he gave them to me
    5: And returning from the mountain, I descended and placed the tablets in the ark, which I had made, and they are still there even now, just as the Lord instructed me
    6: Then the sons of Israel moved their camp, from Beeroth among the sons of Jaakan, into Moserah, where Aaron died and was buried, and where his son Eleazar was installed in the priesthood in his place
    7: From there, they went into Gudgodah. From that place, they set out and camped at Jotbathah, in a land of waters and torrents
    8: At that time, he separated the tribe of Levi, so that he would carry the ark of the covenant of the Lord, and stand before him in the ministry, and speak blessings in his name, even to the present day
    9: As a result, Levi has no portion or possession with his brothers. For the Lord himself is his possession, just as the Lord your God promised him
    10: Then I stood on the mountain, as before, for forty days and nights. And the Lord heeded me at this time also, and he was not willing to destroy you
    11: And he said to me: ‘Go forth and walk before the people, so that they may enter and possess the land, which I swore to their fathers that I would deliver to them.
    12: And now, O Israel, what does the Lord your God require of you? Only that you fear the Lord your God, and walk in his ways, and love him, and serve the Lord your God with your whole heart and with your whole soul
    13: and that you keep the commandments of the Lord, and his ceremonies, which I am instructing to you this day, so that it may be well with you
    14: Lo, heaven belongs to the Lord your God, and the heaven of heaven, and the earth, and all the things that are within these
    15: Now the Lord was closely joined to your fathers, and he loved them, and he chose their offspring after them, that is, you yourselves, out of all the nations, just as is being proven today
    16: Therefore, circumcise the foreskin of your heart, and no longer stiffen your neck
    17: For the Lord your God himself is the God of gods, and the Lord of lords, a God great and powerful and terrible, who favors no person and accepts no bribe
    18: He accomplishes judgment for the orphan and the widow. He loves the sojourner, and he gives him food as well as clothing
    19: Therefore, you also should love sojourners, for you also were new arrivals in the land of Egypt
    20: You shall fear the Lord your God, and him alone shall you serve. You shall cling to him, and you shall swear by his name
    21: He is your praise and your God. He has done for you these great and terrible things, which your eyes have seen
    22: As seventy souls, your fathers descended into Egypt. And now, behold, the Lord your God has multiplied you to be like the stars of heaven.

  Chapter 11.

    1: “And so, love the Lord your God, and observe his precepts and ceremonies, his judgments and commandments, at all times
    2: Acknowledge, on this day, the things that your sons did not know. For they did not see the chastisements of the Lord your God, his great acts, and powerful hand, and outstretched arm
    3: the signs and works that he did in the midst of Egypt, to Pharaoh, the king, and to his entire land
    4: and to the entire army of the Egyptians, and to their horses and chariots: how the waters of the Red Sea covered them as they were pursuing you, and how the Lord wiped them away, even to the present day
    5: and the things that he accomplished for you in the wilderness, until you arrived at this place
    6: and to Dathan and Abiram, sons of Eliab, who was the son of Reuben, those whom the earth, opening its mouth, engulfed with their households and tents, and with their entire substance which they had in the midst of Israel
    7: Your eyes have seen all the great works of the Lord, which he has accomplished
    8: so that you would keep all his commandments, which I entrust to you this day, and so that you would be able to enter and possess the land, toward which you are advancing
    9: and so that you may live, for a long time, in the land which the Lord promised under oath to your fathers, and to their offspring, a land flowing with milk and honey
    10: For the land, which you shall enter and possess, is not like the land of Egypt, from which you departed, where, when seed has been sown, waters are brought in by irrigation, in the manner of gardens
    11: Rather, it has mountainous regions and plains, which lay waiting for rain from heaven
    12: And the Lord your God always visits it, and his eyes are upon it, from the beginning of the year, all the way to its end
    13: So then, if you obey my commandments, which I am instructing to you this day, so that you love the Lord your God, and serve him with your whole heart and your whole soul
    14: he will give to your land the early rain and the late rain, so that you may gather your grain, and your wine, and your oil
    15: and your hay from the fields in order to feed your cattle, and so that you yourselves may eat and be satisfied
    16: Be careful, lest perhaps your heart may be deceived, and you might withdraw from the Lord, and serve strange gods, and adore them
    17: And the Lord, becoming angry, might close up heaven, so that the rain would not descend, nor would the earth produce her seedlings, and then you would quickly perish from the excellent land, which the Lord will give to you
    18: Place these words of mine in your hearts and minds, and hang them as a sign on your hands, and arrange them between your eyes
    19: Teach your sons to meditate on them, when you sit in your house, and when you walk along the way, and when you lie down or rise up
    20: You shall write them upon the doorposts and the gates of your house
    21: so that your days may be multiplied, and the days of your sons, in the land which the Lord swore to your fathers, that he would give it to them for as long as heaven is suspended above the earth
    22: For if you keep the commandments which I am entrusting to you, and if you do them, so that you love the Lord your God, and walk in all his ways, clinging to him
    23: the Lord will scatter all these nations before your face, and you shall possess them, though they are greater and stronger than you
    24: Every place upon which your foot shall tread will be yours. From the desert, and from Lebanon, from the great river Euphrates, as far as the western sea, shall be your borders
    25: No one will stand against you. The Lord your God will spread the terror and dread of you over all the land upon which you shall tread, just as he has spoken to you
    26: Behold, I am setting forth in your sight today a blessing and a curse
    27: It will be a blessing, if you obey the commandments of the Lord your God, which I am instructing to you this day
    28: It will be a curse, if you do not obey the commandments of the Lord your God, but instead you withdraw from the way, which I am revealing to you now, and you walk after foreign gods that you have not known
    29: Yet truly, when the Lord your God will have led you into the land, to which you are traveling for a habitation, you shall place the blessing upon Mount Gerizim, the curse upon Mount Ebal
    30: which are across the Jordan, behind the way which slopes toward the setting of the sun, in the land of the Canaanite, who lives in the plains opposite Gilgal, which is near the valley extending toward and entering a distant place
    31: For you shall cross over the Jordan, so that you may possess the land which the Lord your God will give you, so that you may have it and possess it
    32: Therefore, see to it that you fulfill the ceremonies and judgments, which I am placing in your sight this day.

  Chapter 12.

    1: “These are the precepts and judgments which you must do in the land which the Lord, the God of your fathers, will give to you, so that you may possess it during all the days that you shall walk upon the soil
    2: Overturn all the places where the nations, which you will possess, worshipped their gods on lofty mountains, and on hills, and under every leafy tree
    3: Scatter their altars and break their statues. Burn their sacred groves with fire and crush their idols. Abolish their names from those places
    4: But you shall not do the same to the Lord your God
    5: Instead, you shall approach the place which the Lord your God will choose among all your tribes, so that he may set his name there, and may dwell in that place
    6: And you shall offer, in that place, your holocausts and victims, the tithes and first-fruits of your hands, and your vows and gifts, the firstborn of the cattle and of the sheep
    7: And you shall eat it there, in the sight of the Lord your God. And you shall rejoice in all the things to which you shall set your hand: you and your household, which the Lord your God has blessed for you
    8: You shall not do there the things that we are doing here today: each one doing what seems good to himself
    9: For even until the present time, you did not arrive at the rest and the possession, which the Lord your God will give to you
    10: You shall cross over the Jordan, and you shall live in the land which the Lord your God will give to you, so that you may have rest from all the surrounding enemies, and so that you may live without any fear
    11: in the place which the Lord your God will choose, so that his name may be in it. To that place, you shall bring all the things that I instruct you: holocausts, and victims, and tithes, and the first-fruits of your hands, and whatever is best among the gifts that you shall vow to the Lord
    12: In that place, you shall feast before the Lord your God: you, and your sons and daughters, your men and women servants, as well as the Levite who dwells in your cities. For he has no other portion or possession among you
    13: Take care that you do not offer your holocausts in any place that you see
    14: Instead, you shall offer sacrifices in the place which the Lord will choose within one of your tribes, and you shall do whatsoever I instruct you
    15: So, if you wish to eat, and if the eating of flesh pleases you, then kill and eat according to the blessing of the Lord your God, which he has given to you, in your cities: you may eat it whether it is unclean, that is, having blemish or defect, or whether it is clean, that is, whole and without blemish, of the kind which is permitted to be offered, such as the roe deer and the stag
    16: Only the blood you shall not eat. Instead, you shall pour it upon the ground like water
    17: You may not eat in your towns the tithes of your crops, and your wine and oil, the firstborn of your herds and your flocks, nor anything which you will vow, or which you will offer spontaneously, nor the first-fruits of your hands
    18: But you shall eat these before the Lord your God, in the place which the Lord your God will choose: you, and your son, and your daughter, and your man servant and woman servant, and the Levite who dwells in your cities. And you shall rejoice and be refreshed in the sight of the Lord your God by all the things to which you will extend your hand
    19: Be careful, lest you abandon the Levite, at anytime while you are living in the land
    20: When the Lord your God will have enlarged your borders, just as he has spoken to you, and when you would eat the flesh that your soul desires
    21: but if the place which the Lord your God will choose, so that his name may be there, is far away, you may kill, from your herds and your flocks which you will have, in the manner I have instructed to you, and you may eat in your towns, as it pleases you
    22: Just as the roe deer and the stag may be eaten, so also may you eat these: you may eat both the clean and the unclean alike
    23: Only beware of this: you may not eat the blood. For their blood is for the soul. And because of this, you must not eat the soul with the flesh
    24: Instead, you shall pour it upon the ground like water
    25: so that it may be well with you, and with your sons after you, when you will do what is pleasing in the sight of the Lord
    26: But the things that you have sanctified and vowed to the Lord, you shall take up and bring to the place which the Lord will choose
    27: And you shall offer your oblations of flesh and of blood upon the altar of the Lord your God. You shall poor out the blood of your victims upon the altar. And you yourself shall eat the flesh
    28: Observe and heed all the things that I instruct to you, so that it may be well with you, and with your sons after you, continually, when you will do what is good and pleasing in the sight of the Lord your God
    29: When the Lord your God will have abolished before your face the nations, which you shall enter so as to possess them, and when you will possess them and live in their land
    30: be careful that you do not imitate them, after they have been overturned at your arrival, and that you do not seek their ceremonies, saying: ‘Just as these nations have worshipped their gods, so also will I worship.
    31: You shall not act in like manner toward the Lord your God. For they have done to their gods all the abominations that the Lord spurns, offering their sons and daughters, and burning them with fire
    32: What I command to you, this only shall you do, for the Lord. You may neither add nor subtract anything.
