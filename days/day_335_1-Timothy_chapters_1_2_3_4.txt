Day 335:

Reading 1-Timothy, chapters ['1', '2', '3', '4']:

  Chapter 1.

    1: Paul, an Apostle of Jesus Christ by the authority of God our Savior and Christ Jesus our hope
    2: to Timothy, beloved son in the faith. Grace, mercy, and peace, from God the Father and from Christ Jesus our Lord
    3: Now I asked you to remain at Ephesus, while I went into Macedonia, so that you would speak strongly against certain ones who have been teaching a different way
    4: against those who have been paying attention to fables and endless genealogies. These things present questions as if they were greater than the edification that is of God, which is in faith
    5: Now the goal of instruction is charity from a pure heart, and a good conscience, and an unfeigned faith
    6: Certain persons, wandering away from these things, have been turned aside to empty babbling
    7: desiring to be teachers of the law, but understanding neither the things that they themselves are saying, nor what they are affirming about these things
    8: But we know that the law is good, if one makes use of it properly
    9: Knowing this, that the law was not set in place for the just, but for the unjust and the insubordinate, for the impious and sinners, for the wicked and the defiled, for those who commit patricide, matricide, or homicide
    10: for fornicators, for males who sleep with males, for kidnappers, for liars, for perjurers, and whatever else is contrary to sound doctrine
    11: which is in accord with the Gospel of the glory of the blessed God, the Gospel which has been entrusted to me
    12: I give thanks to him who has strengthened me, Christ Jesus our Lord, because he has considered me faithful, placing me in the ministry
    13: though previously I was a blasphemer, and a persecutor, and contemptuous. But then I obtained the mercy of God. For I had been acting ignorantly, in unbelief
    14: And so the grace of our Lord has abounded greatly, with the faith and love that is in Christ Jesus
    15: It is a faithful saying, and worthy of acceptance by everyone, that Christ Jesus came into this world to bring salvation to sinners, among whom I am first
    16: But it was for this reason that I obtained mercy, so that in me as first, Christ Jesus would display all patience, for the instruction of those who would believe in him unto eternal life
    17: So then, to the King of ages, to the immortal, invisible, solitary God, be honor and glory forever and ever. Amen
    18: This precept I commend to you, my son Timothy, in accord with the prophets who preceded you: that you serve among them like a soldier in a good war
    19: holding to faith and good conscience, against those who, by rejecting these things, have made a shipwreck of the faith
    20: Among these are Hymenaeus and Alexander, whom I have handed over to Satan, so that they may learn not to blaspheme

  Chapter 2.

    1: And so I beg you, first of all, to make supplications, prayers, petitions, and thanksgivings for all men
    2: for kings, and for all who are in high places, so that we may lead a quiet and tranquil life in all piety and chastity
    3: For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Savior
    4: who wants all men to be saved and to arrive at an acknowledgment of the truth
    5: For there is one God, and one mediator of God and of men, the man Christ Jesus
    6: who gave himself as a redemption for all, as a testimony in its proper time
    7: Of this testimony, I have been appointed a preacher and an Apostle, (I speak the truth, I do not lie) as a teacher of the Gentiles, in faith and in truth
    8: Therefore, I want men to pray in every place, lifting up pure hands, without anger or dissension
    9: Similarly also, women should be dressed fittingly, adorning themselves with compunction and restraint, and not with plaited hair, nor gold, nor pearls, nor costly attire
    10: but in a manner proper for women who are professing piety by means of good works
    11: Let a woman learn in silence with all subjection
    12: For I do not permit a woman to teach, nor to be in authority over a man, but to be in silence
    13: For Adam was formed first, then Eve
    14: And Adam was not seduced, but the woman, having been seduced, was in transgression
    15: Yet she will be saved by bearing children, if she has continued in faith and love, and in sanctification accompanied by self-restraint

  Chapter 3.

    1: It is a faithful saying: if a man desires the episcopate, he desires a good work
    2: Therefore, it is necessary for a bishop to be beyond reproach, the husband of one wife, sober, prudent, gracious, chaste, hospitable, a teacher
    3: not a drunkard, not combative but restrained, not quarrelsome, not covetous
    4: but a man who leads his own house well, having children who are subordinate with all chastity
    5: For if a man does not know how to lead his own house, how will he take care of the Church of God
    6: He must not be a new convert, lest, being elated by pride, he may fall under the sentence of the devil
    7: And it is necessary for him also to have good testimony from those who are outside, so that he may not fall into disrepute and the snare of the devil
    8: Similarly, deacons must be chaste, not double-tongued, not given to much wine, not pursuing tainted profit
    9: holding to the mystery of the faith with a pure conscience
    10: And these things should be proven first, and then they may minister, being without offense
    11: Similarly, the women must be chaste, not slanderers, sober, faithful in all things
    12: Deacons should be the husband of one wife, men who lead their own children and their own houses well
    13: For those who have ministered well will acquire for themselves a good position, and much confidence in the faith which is in Christ Jesus
    14: I am writing these things to you, with the hope that I will come to you soon
    15: But, if I am delayed, you should know the manner in which it is necessary to conduct yourself in the house of God, which is the Church of the living God, the pillar and the foundation of truth
    16: And it is clearly great, this mystery of piety, which was manifested in the flesh, which was justified in the Spirit, which has appeared to Angels, which has been preached to the Gentiles, which is believed in the world, which has been taken up in glory

  Chapter 4.

    1: Now the Spirit has clearly said that, in the end times, some persons will depart from the faith, paying attention to spirits of error and the doctrines of devils
    2: speaking lies in hypocrisy, and having their consciences seared
    3: prohibiting marriage, abstaining from foods, which God has created to be accepted with thanksgiving by the faithful and by those who have understood the truth
    4: For every creature of God is good, and nothing is to be rejected which is received with thanksgiving
    5: for it has been sanctified by the Word of God and by prayer
    6: By proposing these things to the brothers, you will be a good minister of Christ Jesus, nourished by words of faith, and by the good doctrine that you have secured
    7: But avoid the silly fables of old women. And exercise yourself so as to advance in piety
    8: For the exercise of the body is somewhat useful. But piety is useful in all things, holding the promise of life, in the present and in the future
    9: This is a faithful saying and worthy of full acceptance
    10: For this reason we labor and are maligned: because we hope in the living God, who is the Savior of all men, most especially of the faithful
    11: Instruct and teach these things
    12: Let no one despise your youth, but be an example among the faithful in word, in behavior, in charity, in faith, in chastity
    13: Until I arrive, attend to reading, to exhortation, and to doctrine
    14: Do not be willing to neglect the grace that is within you, which was given to you through prophecy, with the imposition of the hands of the priesthood
    15: Meditate on these things, so that your progress may be manifest to all
    16: Pay attention to yourself and to doctrine. Pursue these things. For in doing so, you will save both yourself and those who listen to you
