Day 339:

Reading Philemon, chapters ['1']:

  Chapter 1.

    1: Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy, a brother, to Philemon, our beloved fellow laborer
    2: and to Apphia, most beloved sister, and to Archippus, our fellow soldier, and to the church which is in your house
    3: Grace and peace to you, from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ
    4: I give thanks to my God, always keeping remembrance of you in my prayers
    5: (for I am hearing of your charity and faith, which you have in the Lord Jesus and with all the saints
    6: so that the participation of your faith may become evident by the recognition of every good work which is in you in Christ Jesus
    7: For I have found great joy and consolation in your charity, because the hearts of the saints have been refreshed by you, brother
    8: Because of this, I have enough confidence in Christ Jesus to command you concerning certain things
    9: but I beg you instead, for the sake of charity, since you are so much like Paul: an old man and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ
    10: I beg you, on behalf of my son, whom I have begotten in my chains, Onesimus
    11: In times past, he was useless to you, but now he is useful both to me and to you
    12: So I have sent him back to you. And may you receive him like my own heart
    13: I myself wanted to retain him with me, so that he might minister to me, on your behalf, while I am in the chains of the Gospel
    14: But I was willing to do nothing without your counsel, so as not to make use of your good deed as if out of necessity, but only willingly
    15: So perhaps, then, he departed from you for a time, so that you might receive him again for eternity
    16: no longer as a servant, but, in place of a servant, a most beloved brother, especially to me: but how much so more to you, both in the flesh and in the Lord
    17: Therefore, if you hold me to be a companion, receive him as you would me
    18: But if he has harmed you in any way, or if he is in your debt, charge it to me
    19: I, Paul, have written this with my own hand: I will repay. And I need not tell you, that you are also in debt yourself, to me
    20: So it is, brother. May I delight with you in the Lord! Refresh my heart in Christ
    21: I have written to you, trusting in your obedience, knowing, too, that you will do even more than what I say
    22: But also, at once, prepare a lodging for me. For I am hoping, through your prayers, to present myself to you
    23: Greet Epaphras, my fellow captive in Christ Jesus
    24: and Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke, my helpers
    25: May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen
