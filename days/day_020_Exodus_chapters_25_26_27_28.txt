Reading Exodus, chapters ['25', '26', '27', '28']:

  Chapter 25.

    1: And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying
    2: “Speak to the sons of Israel, so that they may take the first-fruits to me. You shall accept these from every man who offers of his own accord
    3: Now these are the things that you must accept: Gold, and silver, and brass
    4: hyacinth and purple, and twice-dyed scarlet, and fine linen, the hair of goats
    5: and the skins of rams, dyed red, and skins of violet, and setim wood
    6: oil to prepare lights, aromatics as ointments and sweet-smelling incense
    7: onyx stones and gems to adorn the ephod as well as the breastplate
    8: And they shall make a sanctuary for me, and I will live in their midst
    9: According to exact likeness of the tabernacle, and all of the vessels for its rituals, that I will reveal to you, so shall you make it
    10: Join together an ark of setim wood, whose length shall hold two and one half cubits; the width, one and one half cubits; the height, likewise, one and one half cubits
    11: And you shall overlay it with the finest gold, inside and out. And over it, you shall fashion a gold crown all around
    12: and four gold rings, which you shall set into the four corners of the ark. Let two rings be on one side and two on the other
    13: Likewise, you shall make bars of setim wood and cover them with gold
    14: And you shall put them through the rings that are in the sides of the ark, so that it may be carried on them
    15: These must always be in the rings, neither shall they ever be drawn out of them
    16: And you shall place the testimony, which I will give to you, in the ark
    17: You shall also make a propitiatory of the finest gold. Its length shall hold two and one half cubits, and the width, one and one half cubits
    18: Likewise, you shall make two Cherubim of formed gold, on both sides of the oracle
    19: Let one Cherub be on the one side, and the other be on the other
    20: And let them cover both sides of the propitiatory, spreading their wings and covering the oracle, and let them look out toward one another, their faces being turned toward the propitiatory, with which the ark is to be covered
    21: in which you will place the testimony that I will give to you
    22: From there, I will warn you and speak to you, above the propitiatory and from the middle of the two Cherubim, which will be over the ark of the testimony, about everything that I will command of the sons of Israel through you
    23: You shall also make a table of setim wood, having two cubits of length, and one cubit in width, and one cubit and one half cubits in height
    24: And you shall overlay it with the purest gold. And you shall make it with a gold lip all around
    25: and for the lip itself an engraved crown, four fingers high, and above it another little gold crown
    26: Likewise, you shall prepare four gold rings and set them in the four corners of the same table, over each foot
    27: Under the crown, there shall be gold rings, so that the bars may be put through them and the table may be carried
    28: Likewise, the bars themselves you shall make of setim wood, and surround them with gold, to lift up the table
    29: You shall also prepare small cups, as well as bowls, censers, and measuring cups, with which the libations shall be offered, out of the purest gold
    30: And you shall place upon the table the bread of the presence, in my sight always
    31: You shall also make a lampstand, formed from the finest gold, along with its stem and arms, its bowl and little spheres, as well as the lilies proceeding from it
    32: Six branches shall go out from the sides: three out of one side and three out of the other
    33: Three bowls, the size of nuts, shall be on each branch, and a little sphere with it, and a lily. And three similar bowls, in the likeness of nuts, shall be on the other branch, and a little sphere with it, and a lily. This shall be the form of the six branches, which are to proceed from the stem
    34: Then, in the lampstand itself, there shall be four bowls, the size of nuts, and each with little spheres and lilies
    35: Little spheres under two branches in three places, which together make six, shall proceed from one of the stems
    36: Thus both the little spheres and the branches shall be made out of the same thing: entirely formed from the purest gold
    37: You shall also make seven lamps, and you shall place them upon the lampstand, so that they may give light in every direction
    38: Likewise, the candle snuffers, and the place where the candles will be extinguished, shall be made from the purest gold
    39: The entire weight of the candlestick, with all its parts, shall hold one talent of the purest gold
    40: Observe, and then make it according to the example that was shown to you on the mountain.

  Chapter 26.

    1: “Truly, thus shall you make the tabernacle: You shall make ten curtains of fine twisted linen, and hyacinth as well as purple, and twice-dyed scarlet, with diverse embroidery
    2: The length of one curtain shall have twenty-eight cubits. The width shall be four cubits. The entire set of curtains shall be of one measure
    3: Five curtains shall be joined to one another, and the other five shall be similarly coupled together
    4: You shall make loops of hyacinth on the sides at the edges of the curtains, so that they will be able to be joined to one another
    5: A curtain shall have fifty loops on each of two sides, inserted in such a manner that loop may come against loop, and one can be fitted to the other
    6: You shall also make fifty rings of gold, with which the veils of the curtains are to be joined, so that it shall be one tabernacle
    7: You shall also make eleven haircloth canopies to cover the roof of the tabernacle
    8: The length of one canopy shall hold thirty cubits, and the width, four. The measure of all the canopies shall be equal
    9: Five of these you shall join by themselves, and six of these you shall couple to one another, in such a manner as to double the sixth canopy at the front of the roof
    10: You shall also make fifty loops along the edge of one canopy, so that it may be able to be joined with the other, and fifty loops along the edge of the other canopy, so that it may be coupled with the other
    11: You shall also make fifty brass buckles, with which the loops may be joined, so that there may be one covering out of all
    12: Then what will be left over of the canopies which are prepared for the roof, that is, one canopy which is in excess, from half of it you shall cover the back of the tabernacle
    13: And one cubit will hang down on one side, and another on the other side, which is more than the length of the curtains, protecting both sides of the tabernacle
    14: You shall also make another covering for the roof from the skins of rams, dyed-red, and above that again, another covering of violet-colored skins
    15: You shall also make the standing panels of the tabernacle from setim wood
    16: Of these, each shall have ten cubits in length, and in width, one and one half
    17: At the sides of the panels, there shall be made two dovetails, by which one panel may be connected to another panel; and in this way all the panels shall be prepared
    18: Of these, twenty shall be at the meridian, which lies toward the south
    19: For these, you shall cast forty bases of silver, so that two bases will lie under each panel at its two corners
    20: Likewise, at the second side of the tabernacle, which lies to the north, there shall be twenty panels
    21: having forty bases of silver; two bases shall support each panel
    22: Truly, toward the western part of the tabernacle, you shall make six panels
    23: and again another two, which will be raised at the corners, behind the back of the tabernacle
    24: And these shall be joined together from bottom to top, and one joint shall retain them all. Likewise, two of the panels, which will be set at the corners, shall be served by similar joints
    25: And together these will be eight panels, and their bases of silver, sixteen, counting two bases for each panel
    26: You shall also make five bars of setim wood, to connect the panels on one side of the tabernacle
    27: and five others on the other side, and the same number toward the western part
    28: These shall be set along the middle of the panels, from one end all the way to the other end
    29: Likewise, the panels themselves you shall overlay with gold, and you shall establish rings of gold in them, by which the bars of the panels may be connected. These you shall cover with layers of gold
    30: And you shall raise the tabernacle according to the example which was shown to you on the mountain
    31: You shall also make a veil of hyacinth, and purple, and twice-dyed scarlet, and fine twisted linen, wrought with a diversity of continuous and beautiful embroidery
    32: And you shall suspend it before four columns of setim wood, which themselves certainly shall be overlaid with gold, and have heads of gold, but bases of silver
    33: Then the veil shall be inserted through the rings. Beyond the veil, you shall place the ark of the testimony, where both the Sanctuary and the Sanctuary of Sanctuaries shall be divided
    34: And you shall place the propitiatory over the ark of the testimony, in the Holy of Holies
    35: And the table shall be outside the veil. And opposite the table shall be the lampstand, in the meridian of the tabernacle. For the table shall stand at the north side
    36: You shall also make a tent at the entrance of the tabernacle from hyacinth, and purple, and twice-dyed scarlet, and fine twisted linen, wrought with embroidery
    37: And you shall overlay with gold five columns of setim wood, over which the tent shall be drawn. The heads of these shall be of gold, and the bases of brass.

  Chapter 27.

    1: “You shall also make an altar of setim wood, which will have five cubits in length, and the same in width, that is, four equal sides, and three cubits in height
    2: Now there shall be horns at the four corners of it, and you shall cover it with brass
    3: And you shall make, for its uses, pans to receive the ashes, and tongs as well as small hooks, and receptacles for fire. You shall fabricate all of its vessels from brass
    4: along with a grating of brass in the manner of a net. At its four corners there shall be four rings of brass
    5: which you shall place under the base of the altar. And the grating will extend even to the middle of the altar
    6: You shall also make, for the altar, two bars of setim wood, which you shall cover with layers of brass
    7: And you shall lead them through the rings, and they will be on both sides of the altar to carry it
    8: You shall not make it solid, but empty and hollow at the interior, just as it was shown to you on the mountain
    9: You shall also make the atrium of the tabernacle, at the southern part of which, opposite the meridian, there shall be hangings of fine twisted linen: one side extending for one hundred cubits in length
    10: And you shall make twenty columns with the same number of bases of brass, the heads of which, with their engravings, shall be made of silver
    11: In like manner also, throughout the length of the north side, there shall be hangings of one hundred cubits, and twenty columns, and the same number of bases of brass, and their heads with their engravings of silver
    12: Yet truly, along the width of the atrium that looks out toward the west, there shall be hangings of fifty cubits, and ten columns, and the same number of bases
    13: Likewise, along the width of the atrium that looks out toward the east, there shall be fifty cubits
    14: along which there shall be assigned hangings of fifteen cubits for one side, and three columns, and the same number of bases
    15: And, along the other side, there shall be hangings occupying fifteen cubits, with three columns and the same number of bases
    16: Yet truly, at the entrance of the atrium, there shall be made a hanging of twenty cubits, of hyacinth and purple, and twice-dyed scarlet, and fine twisted linen, wrought with embroidery. It shall have four columns, with the same number of bases
    17: All the columns surrounding the atrium shall be clothed with layers of silver, with silver heads, and with bases of brass
    18: In length, the atrium shall occupy one hundred cubits, in width, fifty; the height shall be of five cubits. And it shall be made of fine twisted linen, and it shall have bases of brass
    19: All the vessels of the tabernacle, for all uses and ceremonies, even to the tent pegs for its atrium, you shall make of brass
    20: Instruct the sons of Israel so that they may bring you the purest oil of the olive trees, crushed with a pestle, so that a lamp may always bur
    21: in the tabernacle of the testimony, outside of the veil that enshrouds the testimony. And Aaron and his sons shall arrange it, so that it may give light in the presence of the Lord, until morning. This shall be a perpetual observance among the sons of Israel, throughout their successions.

  Chapter 28.

    1: “Also, join to yourself your brother Aaron, with his sons from the midst of the sons of Israel, so that they may exercise the priesthood for me: Aaron, Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar
    2: And you shall make a holy vestment for Aaron, your brother, with glory and elegance
    3: And you shall speak to all the wise of heart, whom I have filled with the spirit of prudence, so that they may make the vestments of Aaron, in which, having been sanctified, he may minister to me
    4: Now these shall be the vestments that they shall make: A breastplate and an ephod, a tunic and a close-fit linen garment, a headdress and a wide belt. They shall make the holy vestments for your brother Aaron and his sons, so that they may exercise the priesthood for me
    5: And they shall receive gold, and hyacinth, and purple, and twice-dyed scarlet, and fine linen
    6: Then they shall make the ephod of gold, and hyacinth, and purple, and twice-dyed scarlet, and fine twisted linen, wrought with diverse colors
    7: It shall have two edges joined at the top on both sides, so that they may respond as one
    8: Likewise, the weaving and all the detail work shall be of gold, and hyacinth, and purple, and twice-dyed scarlet, and fine twisted linen
    9: And you shall take two onyx stones and engrave on them the names of the sons of Israel
    10: six names on one stone, and the remaining six on the other, according to the order of their birth
    11: By the work of a sculptor and the skill of a jeweler, you shall engrave them with the names of the sons of Israel, enclosed and encompassed with gold
    12: And you shall place them on both sides of the ephod, as a memorial to the sons of Israel. And Aaron shall carry their names before the Lord, upon both shoulders, as a remembrance
    13: You shall also make hooks of gold
    14: and two little chains of the purest gold, linked to one another, which you shall insert into the hooks
    15: Likewise, you shall make the breastplate of judgment, wrought with diverse colors according to the weaving of the ephod: of gold, hyacinth and purple, and twice-dyed scarlet, and fine twisted linen
    16: It shall have four corners and be doubled. It shall have the measure of the palm of a hand, both in length and in width
    17: And you shall set within it four rows of stones. In the first row, there shall be a sardius stone, and a topaz, and an emerald
    18: In the second, there shall be a garnet, a sapphire, and a jasper
    19: In the third, there shall be a zircon, an agate, and an amethyst
    20: In the fourth, there shall be a chrysolite, an onyx, and a beryl. They shall be set in gold by their rows
    21: And these shall have the names of the sons of Israel. With twelve names shall they be engraved: each stone with one name from the twelve tribes
    22: You shall make chains of the purest gold, linked one to another, on the breastplate
    23: and two rings of gold, which you shall place at both ends of the breastplate
    24: And the golden chains, you shall join to the rings, which are at its edges
    25: And the ends of the chains themselves, you shall couple with two hooks, on both sides of the ephod, which looks toward the breastplate
    26: You shall also make two rings of gold, which you shall place at the ends of the breastplate, at the borders which are away from the region of the ephod and which look toward its back
    27: And then you shall also make two other rings of gold, which are to be suspended on both sides at the bottom of the ephod, which looks out opposite the face of the lower juncture, so that the breastplate can be fitted to the ephod
    28: And it shall be drawn tight to the rings of the breastplate, by the rings of the ephod, with a hyacinth band, so that the well-constructed juncture will remain in place, and the breastplate and the ephod will not be able to be separated from one another
    29: And Aaron shall carry the names of the sons of Israel on the breastplate of judgment upon his chest, when he enters into the Sanctuary, as a memorial in the presence of the Lord in eternity
    30: Then you shall place in the breastplate of judgment, Doctrine and Truth, which shall then be upon Aaron’s chest, when he enters before the Lord. And he shall wear the judgment of the sons of Israel on his chest, in the sight of the Lord always
    31: And you shall make the tunic for the ephod entirely of hyacinth
    32: and the head will be above its middle, with a hem woven around it, just as is usually made at the end parts of a garment, so that it may not be easily broken
    33: Yet truly, beneath it, at the base of the same tunic, all around, you shall make something like pomegranates, from hyacinth, and purple, and twice-dyed scarlet, with little bells set in their midst
    34: So then, there shall be a little golden bell and a pomegranate, and again another golden bell and a pomegranate
    35: And Aaron will be vested with it during the office of his ministry, so that the sound may be heard when he enters and exits the Sanctuary, in the sight of the Lord, and so that he may not die
    36: And you shall make a plate of the purest gold, in which you shall engrave, with the skill of a sculptor, ‘Holy to the Lord.
    37: And you shall fasten it with a band of hyacinth, and it shall be upon the headdress
    38: hanging in front of the high priest. And Aaron shall carry the iniquities of that which the sons of Israel have offered and sanctified, in all their gifts and donations. But the plate will always be at his forehead, so that the Lord may be well pleased with them
    39: And you shall draw the tunic tight with fine linen, and you shall make a headdress of fine linen, and a wide belt, wrought with embroidery
    40: Furthermore, for the sons of Aaron, you shall prepare linen tunics, and wide belts as well as headdresses, with glory and elegance
    41: And with all these you shall vest your brother Aaron, and his sons with him. And you shall consecrate all their hands, and you shall sanctify them, so that they may exercise the priesthood for me
    42: You shall also make linen undergarments, in order to cover the flesh of their nakedness, from the kidneys all the way to the thighs
    43: And Aaron and his sons will use them when they enter the tabernacle of the testimony, and when they approach toward the altar, in order to minister in the sanctuary, lest, being guilty of iniquity, they may die. It shall be a law forever for Aaron, and for his offspring after him.
