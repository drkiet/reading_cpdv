Day 202:

Reading Sirach, chapters ['40', '41', '42', '43']:

  Chapter 40.

    1: A great occupation was created for all men, and a heavy yoke is upon the sons of Adam, from the day of their departure from their mother’s womb, even until the day of their burial into the mother of all
    2: their thoughts, and the fears of their heart, their imagined expectations, and the day of their end
    3: from him who sits upon a glorious throne, even to him who is humbled in earth and ashes
    4: from him who wears hyacinth and bears a crown, even to him who is covered with rough linen: wrath, envy, tumult, restlessness, and the fear of death, continual anger and contention
    5: And in the time of rest upon his bed, the sleep of the night changes his knowledge
    6: There is little or no rest, and sleep is taken from him, as if on a day of keeping watch
    7: He is disturbed by a vision of his heart, as if he had escaped in a day of warfare. In the time of his salvation, he rose up and wondered that there was no fear
    8: This is so with all flesh, from man even to cattle, but upon sinners it is seven times as great
    9: Add to this: death, bloodshed, contention, and the spear, oppression, famine, and affliction, and scourges
    10: All these things have been created because of iniquity, and it is due to iniquity that the great flood was made
    11: All things that are of the earth shall return to the earth, and all waters shall return to the sea
    12: All bribery and iniquity will be wiped away, but faith shall stand forever
    13: The substance of the unjust will dry up like a river, and will pass away with a noise like loud thunder in a rainstorm
    14: When he opens his hands, he will rejoice. So will transgressors pass away at the consummation
    15: The descendents of the impious will not produce many branches, for they may be compared to dirty roots at the edge of a rock
    16: The weeds, which grow above every water and beside the banks of the river, will be uprooted before all the grass
    17: Grace is like a paradise of blessings, and mercy continues for eternity
    18: The life of a worker, when content with what is sufficient, will become sweet, and in it you will find a treasure
    19: Sons, and the building of a city, will establish a name, but an immaculate wife will be ranked above these things
    20: Wine and music rejoice the heart, but the love of wisdom is above them both
    21: The flute and the psaltery make a sweet melody, but a pleasant word is above them both
    22: Your eye desires elegance and beauty, but verdant fields are above these things
    23: A friend and a companion meet one another in time, but above them both is a wife with her husband
    24: Brothers are a help in time of tribulation, but mercy will liberate, more so than they will
    25: Gold and silver provide a firm position for the feet, but well-spoken counsel is above them both
    26: Ability and strength lift up the heart, but the fear of the Lord is above these things
    27: There is no loss in the fear of the Lord, and it has no need to ask for assistance
    28: The fear of the Lord is like a paradise of blessings, and they have covered it above all glory
    29: Son, in your lifetime you should not be indigent, for it is better to die than to be destitute
    30: The life of him who looks to another man’s table should not be thought of as a way of life. For he feeds his life with another man’s food
    31: But a disciplined and well-taught man will take care of himself
    32: Scarcity will seem sweet to the mouth of the imprudent, but a fire will burn in his belly

  Chapter 41.

    1: O death, how bitter is the memory of you: to a man who has peace in his substance
    2: to a quiet man, and to him whose ways are directed properly in all things, and who still has the strength to take nourishment
    3: O death, your judgment is good to the indigent man, and to him whose strength has diminished
    4: who is failing due to old age, and who is anxious about all things, and to the unbelieving man who has lost patience
    5: Do not choose to dread the judgment of death. Remember the things that occurred before you, and the things that will occur after you. This judgment is from the Lord upon all flesh
    6: And what will happen to you is well-pleasing to the Most High, whether in ten, or one hundred, or one thousand years
    7: For death is no indictment of life
    8: The sons of sinners, and those who pass their time in the manner of the houses of the impious, become sons of abominations
    9: The inheritance of the sons of sinners will perish, and continual disgrace will be with their offspring
    10: The sons of an impious father will complain, for they are in disgrace because of him
    11: Woe to you, impious men, who have abandoned the law of the Most High Lord
    12: And when you are born, you will be born into a curse; and when you die, your portion will be in a curse
    13: All things that are from the earth shall return to the earth. Similarly, the impious will proceed from a curse unto perdition
    14: The grieving of men is in their body, but the name of the impious will be wiped away
    15: Have concern for your good name. For this will continue with you, more so than a thousand precious and great treasures
    16: A good life has its number of days, but a good name will continue forever
    17: Sons, practice discipline peacefully. For what use is there in either concealed wisdom, or undiscovered treasure
    18: Better is the man who hides his foolishness than the man who hides his wisdom
    19: Yet truly, have respect for these things which proceed from my mouth
    20: For it is not good to observe every reverence. And all things do not please all persons in their beliefs
    21: Have shame of these things: of fornication before father and mother, and of a lie before the first leader and the powerful
    22: of a crime before a ruler or a judge, of iniquity before a congregation or a people
    23: of injustice before a companion or a friend, and of the place in which you live
    24: of theft, and of the truth before God, and of the covenant, of reclining to eat bread, and of deceitfulness in giving or receiving
    25: of silence before those who greet you, of looking upon a woman of fornication, and of averting your face from a relative
    26: You should not avert your face from your neighbor, nor should you take away a portion and not restore it
    27: You should not stare at another man’s wife, and nor pursue his handmaid, nor approach her bed
    28: Avoid reproachful speeches before friends, and when you give, you should not place blame

  Chapter 42.

    1: You should not repeat a claim heard from the revealing of a hidden word. And then, truly, you will be without shame, and you will find favor in the sight of all men. You should not accept the reputation of someone, so that you would sin, nor should you be confounded in any of the following things
    2: in the law of the Most High and his covenant, or by giving a judgment to justify the impious
    3: in a word among companions and fellow travelers, or by distributing the inheritance of friends
    4: in the fairness of scales and weights, or in acquiring much or little
    5: by the corruption of buying and negotiating, or in the ample discipline of children, or in causing the side of a wicked servant to bleed
    6: A seal is good over a wicked wife
    7: Where there are many hands, seal and deliver all things by number and weight; and truly, give and receive everything in writing
    8: You should not have shame in correcting the senseless, the foolish, and those youths who would judge their elders. And so shall you be well-instructed in all things and well-approved in the sight of all the living
    9: The vigilance of a father for his daughter is hidden, and his concern for her takes away his sleep. For perhaps, in her adolescence, she might be brought into adulthood. Or when she lives with her husband, she might become hateful
    10: In her virginity, she might be defiled, and then she may be found to be pregnant in her father’s house. Or perhaps, when she lives with her husband, she might stray, or at least become barren
    11: Keep a close watch over a self-indulgent daughter. Otherwise, at some time, she might bring you into disgrace before your enemies, and into disrepute in the city, and into reproach among the people, and so she may confound you before the multitude of the people
    12: She should not choose to gaze upon the beauty of every man, and she should not choose to spend her time in the midst of married women
    13: For a moth goes forth from garments, and iniquity over a man goes forth from a woman
    14: Yet iniquity over a man is better for her than if a married woman, seeking to benefit her, instead leads her into confusion and disgrace
    15: And now, I will remember the works of the Lord, and I will announce what I have seen. The words of the Lord are in his works
    16: The sun illuminates and considers all things, and its work shows the fullness of the glory of the Lord
    17: Has not the Lord caused the holy ones to describe all his miracles, which the all-powerful Lord has firmly established in his glory
    18: He has examined the abyss and the hearts of men. And he has considered their astuteness
    19: For the Lord comprehends all knowledge, and he has gazed upon the signs of the times: announcing the things of the past, as well as the things of the future, and revealing the traces of hidden things
    20: No thought passes by him unnoticed, and no word can conceal itself from him
    21: He has adorned the magnificent works of his wisdom. He is before eternity and even unto eternity. And nothing can be added
    22: and nothing can be taken away. And he has no need of any counselor
    23: O how desirable are all his works! And all that we consider is but a spark
    24: All these works exist, and they remain in the present age, and they all obey him in every purpose
    25: All things are two-fold, one facing another, and he has not made anything to be lacking
    26: He has confirmed each thing as good. And who would tire of beholding his glory

  Chapter 43.

    1: The firmament on high is his beauty; it is the beauty of heaven in a vision of glory
    2: The sun, at its appearance, announces its journey; it is an instrument of wonder, a work of the Most High
    3: At midday, it scorches the earth. And in the presence of its heat, who would be able to endure? It is like the custodian of a furnace in its works of heat
    4: In three ways, the sun acts: scorching the mountains, emitting fiery rays, and shining with its beams that can blind the eyes
    5: Great is the Lord who made it, and at his word, it hurries on its journey
    6: And the moon, in all its phases, serves to mark the seasons and to be a sign of the times
    7: From the moon is the sign of a feast day; it is a light which diminishes at its consummation
    8: A month is named according to its phases, increasing wonderfully at its culmination
    9: It is an instrument of the armies on high, shining gloriously in the firmament of heaven
    10: The glory of the stars is the beauty of heaven; the Lord illuminates the world from on high
    11: At the words of the Holy One, they stand for judgment, and they will never fail in their vigilance
    12: Consider the rainbow, and bless the One who made it; it is very beautiful in its splendor
    13: It encompasses the heavens with the circle of its glory; the hands of the Most High made it appear
    14: By his order, he hastens the snow, and he spurs on the lightning to express his judgment
    15: In like manner, his storehouses are opened, and the clouds fly out like birds
    16: By his greatness, he has positioned the clouds, and the hailstones have been broken
    17: At his glance, the mountains will be shaken, and by his will, the south wind will blow
    18: The voice of his thunder will reverberate through the earth, by a storm from the north, and by a gathering of the whirlwind
    19: And like the birds landing in a flock upon the earth, he sends down the snow; and its descent is like the arrival of a swarm of locusts
    20: The eye is in wonder at the beauty of its whiteness, and the heart is astonished at its falling
    21: He will pour out frost like salt upon the earth. And when it freezes, it will become like the tops of thistles
    22: The cold north wind blows, and the water freezes into crystals; it will rest upon every gathering of water, and it will clothe the water like a breastplate
    23: And it will devour the mountains, and burn the wilderness, and extinguish the greenery, like a fire
    24: Relief for all is in the hurried arrival of a cloud. And the lowly dew will arrive to meet the heat and overpower it
    25: At his word, the wind grows quiet, and by his thought, he appeases the abyss, for the Lord has planted islands in it
    26: Let those who navigate the sea describe its perils. And when we have heard it with our ears, we will wonder
    27: There are illustrious and wondrous works: the various kinds of wild animals, and all manner of cattle, and the great creatures of the sea
    28: Through him, the end of their journey is confirmed, and by his word, all things fit together
    29: We can say much, and yet still lack for words. But the consummation of our words is this: He is in all things
    30: What would we be able to do to glorify him? For the Almighty himself is above all his own works
    31: The Lord is terrible, and exceedingly great, and his power is wonderful
    32: Glorify the Lord as much as you are able, yet still he will far exceed this. For his magnificence is beyond wonder
    33: Bless the Lord and exalt him, as much as you are able. But he is beyond all praise
    34: When you exalt him, use all your ability, and do not cease in this labor. For you can never comprehend him
    35: Who will see him and explain? And who will magnify him, as he is from the beginning
    36: There are many things, hidden from us, which are greater than these things. For we have seen but a few of his works
    37: But the Lord has made all things, and he has given wisdom to those who act with piety
