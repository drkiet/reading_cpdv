Day 118:

Reading Judith, chapters ['5', '6', '7', '8']:

  Chapter 5.

    1: And it was reported to Holofernes, the leader of the military of the Assyrians, that the sons of Israel were preparing themselves to resist, and also that they had closed the mountain passes
    2: And he was enraged with extreme fury and great indignation, and he called together all the leaders of Moab and the leaders of Ammon
    3: And he said to them: “Tell me who this people may be, who obstruct the mountains. And which are their cities, and of what kind, and how many? And then, what may be their power, and what may be their number, and who is king over their military
    4: And why have these, more than all who dwell in the east, shown contempt for us, and have not gone out to meet us, so that they might receive us with peace?
    5: Then Achior, commander of all the sons of Ammon, responding, said: “If you would deign to listen, my lord, I will tell the truth in your sight about this people, who dwell in the mountains, and not a false word will go forth from my mouth
    6: This people is from the progeny of the Chaldeans
    7: These dwelt at first in Mesopotamia, because they were not willing to follow the gods of their fathers, who were in the land of the Chaldeans
    8: And so, forsaking the ceremonies of their fathers, which were with a multitude of gods
    9: they worshipped one God of heaven, who also instructed them to go forth from that place and to dwell in Canaan. And when a famine covered the whole land, they went down into Egypt, and there, through four hundred years, they were so multiplied, that the army of them could not be numbered
    10: And when the king of Egypt oppressed them, and also subjugated them to labor with clay and brick in the building of his cities, they cried out to their Lord, and he struck the entire land of Egypt with various plagues
    11: And when the Egyptians had cast them away from them, and the plague had ceased from them, and they were willing to seize them again and recall them to their servitude
    12: the God of heaven opened the sea to these as they fled, so that the waters were made to stand firm like a wall on either side, and these walked across the bottom of the sea and passed through with dry feet
    13: In that place, when an innumerable army of the Egyptians pursued after them, they were so overwhelmed with the waters, that not even one remained to report to posterity what had happened
    14: In truth, going forth from the Red Sea, they occupied the deserts of mount Sinai, in which man could never dwell, nor a son of man take rest
    15: In that place, bitter fountains became sweet for them to drink, and, through forty years, they continued to receive provisions from heaven
    16: And, although they had entered without bow and arrow, and without shield and sword, their God fought on their behalf and was victorious
    17: And there was no one who could attack this people, except when they withdrew from the worship of the Lord their God
    18: But as often as they worshipped any other, except their own God, they were delivered to plunder, and to the sword, and into reproach
    19: But as often as they were repentant for having withdrawn from the worship of their God, the God of heaven gave them the power to resist
    20: And, indeed, they overthrew the king of the Canaanites, and of the Jebusites, and of the Perizzites, and of the Hethites, and of the Hevites, and of the Amorrhites, and all the powerful ones in Hesebon, and these same possessed their lands and their cities
    21: And, as long as they did not sin in the sight of their God, it was well with them. For their God hates iniquity
    22: And even some years ago, when they had withdrawn from the way that their God had given them to walk, they were destroyed in battles by many nations and very many of them were led away captive into a land not their own
    23: But, more recently, returning to the Lord their God, from the dispersion in which they had been scattered, they have united and have ascended into all these mountains, and they again possess Jerusalem, where their holy things are
    24: Therefore, now my lord, inquire if there may be any iniquity of theirs in the sight of their God. If so, let us ascend to them, because their God will surely deliver them to you, and they will be subjugated under the yoke of your power
    25: But if, in truth, there may be no offense of this people before their God, we will not be able to resist them, because their God will defend them, and we will become a disgrace to the whole earth.
    26: And it happened, when Achior had ceased to speak these words, all the great men of Holofernes were angry, and they intended to execute him, saying to each other
    27: “Who is this, that says the sons of Israel are able to resist king Nebuchadnezzar and his armies: unarmed men, and without strength, and without skill in the art of fighting
    28: Therefore, so that Achior may know that he has failed us, let us ascend to the mountains. And, when the most powerful among them have been taken, then, with them, he will be impaled with the sword
    29: So may every people know that Nebuchadnezzar is god of the earth, and there is no other, except him.

  Chapter 6.

    1: But when they had ceased speaking, it happened that Holofernes, being very indignant, said to Achior
    2: “Because you have prophesied to us, saying that the people of Israel may be defended by their God, and so as to reveal to you that there is no God, except Nebuchadnezzar
    3: when we will have struck them all as one man, then you also will pass away with them by the sword of the Assyrians, and all Israel will perish into perdition with you
    4: And you will be shown that Nebuchadnezzar is the lord of the whole earth. And then, the sword of my army will pass through your sides, and, being stabbed, you will fall among the wounded of Israel, and you will breathe no longer, when you have been destroyed with them
    5: And furthermore, if you consider your prophecy to be true, do not let your countenance fall, and let the paleness that has taken hold of your face depart from you, if you claim that these my words cannot be fulfilled
    6: But so that you may know that you will experience these things together with them, behold, from this hour you will be associated with their people, so that, when they receive the punishment that they deserve from my sword, you will fall under the same vengeance.
    7: Then Holofernes instructed his servants to apprehend Achior, and to lead him through to Bethulia, and to deliver him into the hands of the sons of Israel
    8: And, taking him, the servants of Holofernes traveled through the plains. But when they approached close to the mountains, the slingers of stones went forth against them
    9: Then, diverting by the side of the mountain, they tied Achior, hands and feet, to a tree, and so they abandoned him, bound with ropes, and they returned to their lord
    10: Thereafter, the sons of Israel, descending from Bethulia, came to him. Releasing him, they brought him to Bethulia. And so, standing him in the midst of the people, they interrogated him as to what event caused the Assyrians to abandon him, bound
    11: In those days, the rulers of that place were Uzziah, the son of Micah of the tribe of Simeon, and Chabris, also called Gothoniel
    12: And so, in the midst of the elders and in the sight of everyone, Achior explained all that he had said in reply to the questioning of Holofernes, and in what manner the people of Holofernes wanted to have him killed because of this word
    13: and how Holofernes himself, being angry, had ordered him to be handed over to the Israelites, for this reason: so that when he would prevail over the sons of Israel, then he would also command Achior himself to be executed by diverse torments, because he had said that the God of heaven is their defender
    14: And when Achior had declared all these things, all the people fell on their faces, adoring the Lord, and, communing together with mourning and weeping, they poured out their prayers with one mind to the Lord
    15: saying: “O Lord, God of heaven and earth, behold their arrogance, and gaze upon our humility, and attend to the face of your holy ones, and reveal that you do not abandon those who rely on you, and that those who rely on themselves and who glory in their own strength, you humble.
    16: And so, when their weeping was ended, and the prayer of the people throughout the entire day was completed, they consoled Achior
    17: saying: “The God of our fathers, whose power you have predicted, will give to you this in return: that you, instead, will see the destruction of them
    18: Truly, when the Lord our God will give this freedom to his servants, may God also be with you in our midst, so that, just as it pleases you, everyone who is with you may keep company with us.
    19: Then Uzziah, after the council was ended, received him into his own house, and he made him a great supper
    20: And all the elders were invited; together they refreshed themselves at the completion of their fast
    21: In truth, after this, all the people were called together, and they prayed throughout the entire night within the assembly, petitioning help from the God of Israel

  Chapter 7.

    1: But Holofernes, on another day, instructed his army to ascend against Bethulia
    2: Moreover, there were one hundred and twenty thousand foot-soldiers, and twenty-two thousand horsemen, besides the contingents of those men who had been taken captive, and all the youths who had been abducted from the provinces and the cities
    3: All these prepared themselves together to fight against the sons of Israel, and they came through the foothills of the mountain, even to the apex, which looks down upon Dothain, from the place which is called Belma, up to Chelmon, which is opposite Esdrelon
    4: But the sons of Israel, when they saw the multitude of them, prostrated themselves upon the ground, scattering ashes over their heads, praying with one accord that the God of Israel would show his mercy upon his people
    5: And, taking up their arms of war, they set up positions at the places that lead along a narrow footpath between the mountains, and they guarded them all day and night
    6: Now Holofernes, while circling around, discovered that the fountain that flowed in to them, led directly through an aqueduct on the south side, beyond the city. And he instructed their aqueduct to be cut off
    7: Even so, there were springs not far from the walls, from which they were seen to draw water secretly, to refresh themselves a little rather than to drink their fill
    8: But the sons of Ammon and Moab approached Holofernes, saying: “The sons of Israel do not trust in their lances, nor in their arrows, but the mountains are their defense, and the steep hills and precipices constitute their fortifications
    9: Therefore, so that you may be able to overcome them without joining battle, set guards at the springs so that they may not draw water from them, and you will put them to death without the sword, or at least, being weary, they will hand over their city, which they suppose to be, by its position in the mountains, unable to be conquered.
    10: And these words were pleasing before Holofernes and before his attendants, and so he stationed a hundred men around every spring
    11: And when they had kept this watch through twenty full days, the cisterns and collections of waters failed among all the inhabitants of Bethulia, so that there was within the city not enough to satisfy them for even one day, because water was given out to the people daily by measure
    12: Then, all the men and women, youths and little ones, gathering together before Uzziah, all with one voice together
    13: said: “May God be judge between us and you, for you have done evil with us, in not being willing to speak peacefully with the Assyrians, and because of this, God has sold us into their hands
    14: And therefore, there is no one to help us, while we are prostrated before their eyes with thirst and great destruction
    15: And now, gather together all who are in the city, so that we may willingly deliver everyone of us to the people of Holofernes
    16: For it is better that as captives, being alive, we should bless the Lord, than that we should die and become a disgrace to all flesh, after we have seen our wives and our children die before our eyes
    17: We call to witness this day heaven and earth, and the God of our fathers, who takes vengeance upon us according to our sins, so that now you may deliver the city into the hand of the military of Holofernes. And may our end be brief, by the edge of the sword, that would be made longer by the dryness of thirst.
    18: And when they had said these things, there happened a great weeping and a loud lamentation within the assembly. From everyone and for many hours, with one voice, they cried out to God, saying
    19: “We have sinned like our fathers, we have acted unjustly, we have committed iniquity
    20: May you have mercy on us, for you are pious, or with your own scourges avenge our iniquities, but do not be willing to deliver those trusting in you to a people who are ignorant of you
    21: so that they may not say among the Gentiles, ‘Where is their God?’ 
    22: And when, being weary from these outcries, and tired from these weepings, they became silent
    23: Uzziah, rising up covered in tears, said: “Be steadfast in soul, brothers, and let us wait these five days for mercy from the Lord
    24: For perhaps he will break off his indignation and give glory to his own name
    25: But if, with five days passing, help does not arrive, we will accomplish the words that you have spoken.

  Chapter 8.

    1: And it happened that these words were heard by Judith, a widow who was the daughter of Merari, the son of Idox, the son of Joseph, the son of Oziel, the son of Elai, the son of Jamnor, the son of Gideon, the son of Raphaim, the son of Ahitub, the son of Melchiel, the son of Enan, the son of Nathaniel, the son of Salathiel, the son of Simeon, the son of Ruben
    2: And her husband was Manasseh, who died in the days of the barley harvest
    3: For he was standing over those who bound sheaves in the field, and the heat overcame his head, and he died in Bethulia, his own city, and he was buried there with his fathers
    4: But Judith, his bereaved, was a widow now for three years and six months
    5: And she made herself a private chamber in the upper part of her house, in which she stayed enclosed with her handmaids
    6: And she had haircloth around her waist, and she fasted all the days of her life, except Sabbaths, and new moons, and the feasts of the house of Israel
    7: Moreover, she was exceedingly elegant in appearance, and her husband left her many riches, and an abundant household, as well as the ownership of plentiful herds of oxen and flocks of sheep
    8: And she was greatly renowned among all, because she feared the Lord very much, nor was there anyone who spoke an ill word about her
    9: And so, when she heard that Uzziah had promised that he would hand over the city with the passing of five days, she sent to the elders Chabris and Charmis
    10: And they came to her, and she said to them: “What is this word, by which Uzziah has consented to hand over the city to the Assyrians, if within five days no help arrives for us
    11: And who are you to test the Lord
    12: This is not a word that will provoke mercy, but rather one that may excite wrath and enkindle fury
    13: You have set a time limit for the mercy of the Lord, and you have established a day for him, according to your choice
    14: But, since the Lord is patient, let us be repentant about this same matter, and let us beg his indulgence with many tears
    15: For God will not threaten like man, nor will he be inflamed to anger like a son of man
    16: And, for this reason, let us humble our souls before him, and, continuing to serve him in a spirit of humility
    17: let us speak to the Lord with tears, so that he may act according to his will in his mercy toward us. So then, just as our heart is disturbed by their arrogance, so also may we glory in our humility
    18: For we have not followed the sins of our fathers, who abandoned their God in order to worship strange gods
    19: Because of this crime, they were given over to their enemies: to the sword, and to pillaging, and to confusion. But we know no other God except him
    20: Let us wait with humility for his consolation, and the Lord our God will requite our blood by the afflictions of our enemies, and he will humble all the nations that will rise up against us, and he will cause them to be without honor
    21: And now, brothers, because you are the elders among the people of God, and their very soul hangs upon you, rescue their hearts by your eloquence, so that they may remember that our fathers were tested in order to prove whether or not they truly worshiped their God
    22: They are obliged to remember how our father Abraham was tested, and being proved by many tribulations, he was made the friend of God
    23: So Isaac, so Jacob, so Moses, and all that have pleased God, passed through many tribulations, remaining faithful
    24: But those who did not accept the trials with the fear of the Lord, and who brought forward their impatience and the disgrace of their murmuring against the Lord
    25: were exterminated by the exterminator, and they perished by serpents
    26: And as for us, therefore, let us not revenge ourselves for these things that we suffer
    27: But, in considering these same sufferings to be less than our sins deserve, let us believe that the scourges of the Lord, by which we are corrected like servants, have occurred for our improvement and not for our destruction.
    28: And Uzziah and the elders said to her: “All the things that you have spoken are true, and there is nothing reprehensible in your words
    29: Now, therefore, pray for us, because you are a holy woman, and one fearing God.
    30: And Judith said to them: “You know that what I have been able to say is of God
    31: So, concerning that which I propose to do, examine whether or not it is from God, and pray that God may act to strengthen my plan
    32: You will stand at the gate this night, and I will go forth with my handmaid. And pray that, just as you have said, within five days the Lord may look kindly on his people Israel
    33: But I am not willing to have you examine my actions, and, until I report to you, let nothing else be done, except to pray for me to the Lord our God.
    34: And Uzziah, the leader of Judah, said to her, “Go in peace, and may the Lord be with you to take revenge among our enemies.” So, turning back, they departed
