Day 190:

Reading Wisdom, chapters ['13', '14', '15', '16']:

  Chapter 13.

    1: But all men are vain, who are not under the knowledge of God, and who, from these good things that are seen, were not able to understand he who is, nor, by paying attention to the works, did they acknowledge he who was the artisan
    2: Instead, they had considered either the fire, or the air, or the atmosphere, or the circle of stars, or the great sea, or the sun and moon, to be the gods that rule the world
    3: If they, being delighted by such sights, supposed them to be gods, let them know how great the Lord of them is in splendor. For he who created all things is the author of beauty
    4: Or, if they wondered at their power and their effects, let them understand by these things, that he who created them is mightier than they are
    5: For, by the greatness of the creation and its beauty, the creator of these will be able to be seen discernibly
    6: Yet, up to this point, the complaint about this is lesser. For perhaps they made a mistake in this, while desiring and seeking to find God
    7: And, indeed, having some familiarity with him through his works, they search, and they are persuaded, because the things that they are seeing are good
    8: But, then again, neither can their debt be ignored
    9: For, if they were able to know enough so that they could value the universe, how is it they did not easily discover the Lord of it
    10: Yet they are unhappy, and their hope is among the dead, for they have called ‘gods’ the works of the hands of men, gold and silver, the inventions of skill, and the likeness of animals, or a useless stone, the work of an ancient hand
    11: Or, it is as if a craftsman, a workman of the forest, had cut straight wood, and, with his expertise, shaved off all of its bark, and, with his skill, diligently fashioned a vessel, practical for use in life
    12: and even the remains of his work were exhausted in the preparation of food
    13: and, from the remainder of this, which has become useful for nothing, a curved piece of wood and full of knots, he diligently carves it in his spare time, and, through the knowledge of his art, forms it and makes it in the image of a man
    14: or something comparable to an animal, thoroughly rubbing it with red ochre, to make it red with the color of the pigment, and to cover every imperfection which is in it
    15: and it is as if he made a fitting resting place for it, even setting it in a wall and fastening it with iron
    16: providing for it, lest it should fall, knowing that it is unable to help itself, for it is an image and it is in need of help
    17: And then, making an offering, he inquires about his wealth, and about his sons, and about marriage. And he is not ashamed to talk to that which has no soul
    18: And for health, indeed, something unhealthy is being prayed to, and for life, he petitions what is dead, and for help, he calls upon something helpless
    19: and for a good journey, he entreats that which is unable to walk, and for acquiring, and for working, and for success in all things, he entreats that which is useless in all things

  Chapter 14.

    1: Again, another, thinking to sail, and beginning to make his voyage through the raging waves, calls upon a piece of wood more fragile than the wood that carries him
    2: For this is what desire has contrived to be acquired, and the craftsman has formed its understanding
    3: But your providence, O Father, governs, because you have provided for both a way in the sea and a very reliable path among the waves
    4: revealing that you are able to save out of all things, even if someone were to go to sea without skill
    5: But, so that the works of your wisdom might not be empty, therefore, men trust their souls even to a little piece of wood, and, crossing over the sea by raft, they are set free
    6: But, from the beginning, when the proud giants were perishing, the hope of the world, fleeing by boat, gave back to future ages a seed of birth, which was governed by your hand
    7: For blessed is the wood through which justice is made
    8: But, through the hand that makes the idol, both it, and he who made it, is accursed:  he, indeed, because it has been served by him, and it, because, though it is fragile, it is called ‘god.
    9: But the impious and his impiety are similarly offensive to God
    10: For that which is made, together with him who made it, will suffer torments
    11: Because of this, and according to the idolatries of the nations, there will be no refuge, for the things created by God have been made into hatred, and into a temptation to the souls of men, and into a snare for the feet of the foolish
    12: For the beginning of fornication is the search for idols, and from their invention comes corruption of life
    13: For they neither existed from the beginning, nor will they exist forever
    14: For by the great emptiness of men they came into the world, and therefore their end is soon discovered
    15: For a father, embittered with the suffering of grief, made an image of his son, who had been suddenly taken away from him, and then, he who had died as a man, now begins to be worshiped as if a god, and so rites and sacrifices are established among his servants
    16: Then, in the course of time, iniquity gains strength within this erroneous custom, so that this error has been observed as if it were a law, and this figment has been worshiped at the command of tyrants
    17: And those, whom men could not openly honor because they were far off, a likeness of them was carried from far off, and from it they made a similar image of the king that they wanted to honor, so that, by their solicitude, they might worship he who was absent, just as if he were present
    18: Yet, it passes into their care, and those whom they did not know, they love because of the excellence of the artist
    19: For he, wishing to please the one who hired him, embellished his art, so as to fashion a better likeness
    20: But the multitude of men, brought together by the beauty of the work, now considered him to be a god, whom they had formerly honored as a man
    21: And this was the deception of human life:  that men, serving either their own inclination or their kings, assigned the unutterable name to stones and wood
    22: And it was not enough for them to go astray concerning the knowledge of God, but also, while living in a great war of ignorance, they call so many and such great evils ‘peace.
    23: For either they sacrifice their own sons, or they make dark sacrifices, or they hold vigils full of madness
    24: so that now they neither protect life, nor preserve a clean marriage, but one kills another through envy, or grieves him by adultery
    25: And all things are mixed together:  blood, murder, theft and fraud, corruption and infidelity, disturbances and perjury, disorder within good things
    26: forgetfulness of God, pollution of souls, alteration of procreation, inconstancy of marriage, unnatural adultery and homosexuality
    27: For the worship of unspeakable idols is the cause, and the beginning and the end, of all evil
    28: For they either act with madness while happy, or they insistently speak wild lies, or they live unjustly, or they are quick to commit perjury
    29: For, while they trust in idols, which are without a soul, vowing evil, they hope not to be harmed themselves
    30: Therefore, from both sides it will fittingly happen, because they have thought evil of God, paying attention to idols, and because they have sworn unjustly, in guile despising justice
    31: For swearing is not virtue, but sinning always comes around to a punishment according to the transgression of the unjust

  Chapter 15.

    1: But you, our God, are gracious and true, patient, and in mercy ordering all things
    2: And, indeed, if we sin, we are yours, knowing your greatness; and, if we do not sin, we know that we are counted with you
    3: For to have known you is perfect justice, and to know justice and your virtue is the root of immortality
    4: For the skillful planning of evil men has not led us into error, nor the shadow of a picture, a fruitless labor, an image having been sculpted through the use of diverse colors
    5: the sight of which gives desire to the foolish, and he loves the likeness of a lifeless image without a soul
    6: Deserving are the lovers of evil, those who hope in such things, and those who make them, and those who love them, and those who promote them
    7: But even the potter, pressing laboriously, molds the soft earth into vessels, each one for our use. And from the same clay he molds vessels, those which are for clean use, and similarly, those which are for the opposite. But, as to what is the use of a vessel, the potter is the judge
    8: And with effort he molds an empty god of the same clay, he who a little before had been made from the earth, and, after brief time, he himself returns from whence he came, to be claimed by he who holds the debt of his soul
    9: Yet his concern is, not what his work will be, nor that his life is short, but that he is being contested by those who work with gold and silver, yet he also does the same to those who work with copper, and he glories that he makes worthless things
    10: For his heart is ashes, and his hope is worthless dirt, and his life is more common than clay
    11: because he ignores the One who molded him, and who instilled in him a working soul, and who breathed into him a living spirit
    12: Yet they even considered our life to be a plaything, and the usefulness of life to be the accumulation of wealth, and that we must be acquiring things in every possible way, even from evil
    13: For, above all else, he knows himself to be lacking, who, from fragile material of the earth forms vessels and graven images
    14: For all the foolish and unhappy, in charge of the way of the arrogant soul, are enemies of your people and rule over them
    15: because they have esteemed all the idols of the nations as gods, which neither have the use of eyes to see, nor noses to draw breath, nor ears to hear, nor the fingers of hands to grasp, and even their feet are slow to walk
    16: For man made them, and he who borrowed his own breath, formed them. For no man will be able to form God in the likeness of himself
    17: For, being mortal, he forms a dead thing with his unjust hands. Yet, he is better than those things that he worships, because he indeed has lived, though he is mortal, but they never have
    18: Moreover, they worship the most miserable animals, for, to make a foolish comparison, these others are worse
    19: But not even from their appearance can anyone discern anything good in these animals. Yet they have fled from the praise of God, and from his blessing

  Chapter 16.

    1: Because of this, and by means of things similar to these, they were allowed to endure fitting torments, and they were exterminated by a multitude of beasts
    2: Instead of these torments, you administered your people kindly, giving them a desire for a new taste from your delights, and preparing quails for their food
    3: so that, even those desiring food, because of those things which were sent and revealed to them, were now turned away from a necessary desire. Yet these, after a brief time, having become weak, tasted a new food
    4: For it was necessary, though they are without excuse, for them to unexpectedly come upon the ruin of exercising tyranny, yet this was as if to show them how their enemies were being exterminated
    5: And so, when fierce beasts overcame them in anger, they were exterminated by the bites of perverse snakes
    6: But your anger did not continue forever, though they were troubled for a short time for their correction, they have a sign of salvation as a remembrance of the commandment of your law
    7: For he who turned to it was not healed by what he saw, but by you, the Savior of all
    8: Yet in this you revealed to our enemies that you are he who delivers from all evil
    9: For they were killed by the biting of locusts and flies, and there was found no remedy for their life, because they deserved to be destroyed by such things
    10: But not even the teeth of venomous serpents conquered your sons, for your mercy came to them and healed them
    11: For, in remembrance of your words, they were examined and were quickly saved, for forgetfulness is not engraved into your altar so that they would be unable to obtain your help
    12: And, indeed, neither an herb, nor a poultice, healed them, but your word, O Lord, which heals all
    13: For it is you, O Lord, who holds the power of life and death; you both lead to the threshold of death and you restore
    14: Yet man, indeed, kills his own soul through malice, and when his spirit goes forth, it will not be returned, nor will he call back his soul when it has been received
    15: But it is impossible to escape your hand
    16: For the impious, having refused to know you, have been scourged by the strength of your arm, enduring persecution by unusual waters, and by hailstorms, and by rain storms, and being consumed by fire
    17: For there was something extraordinary in water, which extinguishes all things; it has prevailed more than fire; for the world is the defender of the just
    18: Indeed, at a certain time, the fire was subdued, so as not to burn away the animals, which were sent against the impious; and so that, in seeing this, they might know that they are suffering persecution by the judgment of God
    19: And, at another time, fire burned, beyond its own power, in the midst of water, and it flared up from all around, so as to destroy the nations of an unjust land
    20: Instead of these things, you nourished your people with the food of angels, and, having prepared bread from heaven, you served them without labor that which holds within itself every delight and the sweetness of every flavor
    21: For your nature showed your sweetness, which you hold within your sons, and serving the will of each one, it was converted to what each one preferred
    22: But snow and ice held back the strength of fire, and did not melt, so that they might know that fire, burning in the hail and flashing in the rain, destroyed the fruits of the enemies
    23: Yet it was also the case, so that the just might be nourished, that fire had even been deprived of its own power
    24: For the creature serving you, the Creator, grows red hot in the midst of the conflict against the unjust, and yet it subsides for the benefit of those who trust in you
    25: Because of this, and at that time, having been transfigured in all things, your grace was diligently serving as the nursemaid of all things, according to the will of those who long for you
    26: so that your sons, whom you loved, O Lord, might know that it is not the fruits of nature which feed men, but your word, which preserves those who believe in you
    27: For that which could not be destroyed by fire, was immediately melted when warmed by a few rays of the sun
    28: so that it might be clear to all that it is right to come before the sun to bless you, and to adore you at the dawning of the light
    29: For the hope of the ungrateful will melt away like the winter’s ice and will disperse like overflowing water
