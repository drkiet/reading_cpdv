Day 200:

Reading Sirach, chapters ['32', '33', '34', '35']:

  Chapter 32.

    1: Have they appointed you as a leader? Do not be willing to be extolled. Be among them as one of them
    2: Have concern for them, and in this way sit down with them, and when you have explained all your concerns, sit back
    3: Then you may rejoice because of them, and you may receive a crown as an adornment of grace, and so obtain the dignity of the assembly
    4: Speak, you who are greater by birth. For it is fitting for yo
    5: to speak the first word with careful knowledge. But you should not hinder the music
    6: Where no one is listening, you should not pour out words. And do not choose to be extolled improperly for your wisdom
    7: A gemstone of garnet is set amid an ornament of gold, and a concert of music is set amid a banquet of wine
    8: Just as a signet of emerald is set amid a work of gold, so is a melody of music set amid delightful and moderate wine
    9: Listen silently, and for your reverence, good graces will be added to you
    10: Young man, speak in your own case only reluctantly
    11: If you have been asked twice, let your response be concise
    12: In many matters, be as if you lack knowledge, and listen silently as well as intently
    13: In the midst of great men, you should not be presumptuous. And where the elders are present, you should not speak much
    14: Lightning goes before a hailstorm, and grace goes before modesty. And so, for your reverence, good graces will be added to you
    15: And at the hour for rising, you should not be lax. Later, be the first to run ahead to your house, and there withdraw, and there take your pastime
    16: And act according to your intentions, but not in sin and not in arrogant speech
    17: And for all these things, bless the Lord, who made you, and who fills you to overflowing with all his good things
    18: Whoever fears the Lord will accept his doctrine. And whoever watches for him diligently will find a blessing
    19: Whoever seeks the law will be filled from the law. But whoever acts with treachery will be scandalized by treachery
    20: Those who fear the Lord will find just judgment, and they will kindle justice like a light
    21: A sinful man will shun correction, and he will find a rationalization in accord with his own will
    22: A man of counsel will not reject understanding. A strange and arrogant man will not be disturbed by fear
    23: Even so, after he has acted out of fear and without counsel, he will be rebuked by his own criticism
    24: Son, you should do nothing without counsel, and then you will not regret what you have done
    25: You should not go into the way of ruin, and you then will not stumble on stones. You should not commit yourself to a laborious way; otherwise, you may set up a scandal against your own soul
    26: And be cautious concerning your own sons. And be attentive to those of your own household
    27: In all of your works, trust your soul to faith. For this is the keeping of the commandments
    28: Whoever believes God attends to the commandments. And whoever trusts in him will not be diminished

  Chapter 33.

    1: No evils will befall one who fears the Lord. Instead, God will preserve him during temptation and will free him from evils
    2: A wise man does not hate the commandments and the justices, and so he will not be thrown about violently, like a ship in a storm
    3: A man of understanding puts his faith in the law of God, and so the law is faithful to him
    4: Whoever would resolve a dispute will prepare a word, and so, having prayed, he will be heard. And he will observe discipline, and then he will respond
    5: The heart of a fool is like the wheel of a cart. And his thoughts are like a turning axel
    6: A friend who is a whisperer is like an untamed horse: he neighs under anyone who sits upon him
    7: Why does day follow after day, and light follow after light, and year follow after year, in accord with the sun
    8: By the knowledge of the Lord, they were arranged, after the sun was made, in keeping with his command
    9: And so, the seasons changed, with their feast days. And according to them, they celebrated the feast days, in their hour
    10: Some of them, God exalted and magnified. And some of them, he set amid the ordinary days. And all men are from the ground, and from the earth, from which Adam was created
    11: With a mulititude of disciplines, the Lord has distinguished them and diversified their ways
    12: Some of them, he has blessed and exalted. And some of them he has sanctified and placed close to himself. And some of them, he has cursed and brought low, and he has turned them from their station
    13: Just as the clay is in the potterâ€™s hand, so as to form and to shape it
    14: so are all his ways in accord with his dispensation, and so is man in the hand of the One who made him. And he will repay him according to his judgment
    15: Good is against evil, and life is against death; so also is a sinner against a just man. And so should you consider all the works of the Most High: two and two, and one against another
    16: And I awakened at the very end, and I was like one who gathers grapes after the grape-gatherers
    17: I, too, have hoped in the blessing of God. And I have filled the winepress like one who gathers grapes
    18: Consider how I have not labored for myself alone, but for all who are seeking discipline
    19: Listen to me, you great ones, with all the peoples. And incline your ears, you rulers of the Church
    20: You should not give authority over yourself to a son or wife, to a brother or friend, in your life. And you should not give your estate to another, lest perhaps you may regret it, and then you would be begging for the same
    21: While you are still living and breathing, let no one among all flesh change you
    22: For it is better if your children petition you, than if you look toward the hands of your children
    23: In all your works, be pre-eminent
    24: You should not allow a blemish upon your glory. On the day of the consummation of the days of your life, at the time of your passing, distribute your inheritance
    25: Fodder and a rod and a burden are for a donkey; bread and discipline and work are for a servant
    26: He works under discipline, and he seeks rest. Allow his hands to be idle, and he seeks liberty
    27: The yoke and the strap bend a stiff neck, and continual labors bend a servant
    28: Torture and chains are for a malevolent servant; send him to work, so that he may not be idle
    29: For idleness has taught much evil
    30: Appoint him to a task. For this is fitting for him. And if he will not be obedient, bend him with chains. But you should do no more than any flesh can bear. Truly, you should do nothing grievous without judgment
    31: If you have a faithful servant, let him be to you like your own soul. Treat him like a brother. For you have obtained him by the blood of your soul
    32: If you harm him unjustly, he will turn away and flee
    33: And then, when he lifts himself up and departs, you will not know whom to ask, or in what way to seek him

  Chapter 34.

    1: The hopes of a senseless man are empty and false; and dreams extol the imprudent
    2: Like one who chases a shadow and pursues the wind, so also is one who pays attention to lying visions
    3: In the vision of dreams, one thing represents another, as when a mask is before the face of a man
    4: What can be cleansed by the unclean? And what truth can be spoken from a lie
    5: Erroneous divinations and false signs and the dreams of evildoers are emptiness
    6: For your heart suffers from imagination, like a woman suffering in childbirth. Unless it is a visitation sent from the Most High, you should not set your heart upon it
    7: For dreams have caused many to go astray, and those who have hoped in them have fallen away
    8: The word of the law will be fulfilled without a lie, and wisdom will be made plain in the mouths of the faithful
    9: He who has not been tested, what does he know? A man with much experience will consider many things. And whoever has learned much will explain with understanding
    10: He who has no experience knows little. And he who has done many things has made many mistakes
    11: He who has not been tested, what kind of things can he know? He who has been deceived will be more cunning
    12: I have seen much by wandering, and the customs of many things
    13: At times, I have even been in danger of death because of these things, but I was freed by the grace of God
    14: The spirit of those who fear God is sought, and they will be blessed by his providence
    15: For their hope is in him who saves them, and the eyes of God are on those who love him
    16: Those who fear the Lord will tremble at nothing, and they will not be terrified. For he is their hope
    17: The soul of him who fears the Lord is blessed
    18: To whom should he look, and who is his strength
    19: The eyes of the Lord are upon those who fear him. He is a powerful Protector, a Firmament of virtue, a Shelter from the heat, and a Covering from the midday sun
    20: a Guardian from offenses, and a Helper from falling, who exalts the soul and illuminates the eyes, and who gives health and life and blessing
    21: An immolation from iniquity is a stained oblation, and the derisions of the unjust are not well pleasing
    22: The Lord is only for those who persevere for him in the way of truth and justice
    23: The Most High does not approve of the gifts of the iniquitous. Neither does he have respect for the oblations of the unjust; neither will he forgive their sins because of the multitude of their sacrifices
    24: Whoever offers a sacrifice from the substance of the poor is like one who sacrifices the son in the sight of his father
    25: The bread of the indigent is the life of the poor. Whoever cheats them out of it is a man of blood
    26: Whoever takes away the bread of sweat is like one who kills his neighbor
    27: He who sheds blood, and he who cheats the hired hand out of his wages, are brothers
    28: When one builds and another destroys, what benefit do they have from their labor
    29: When one prays and another curses, whose voice will God heed
    30: He who washes himself after touching the dead, and then touches him again, what was the benefit of his washing
    31: Similarly, a man who fasts for his sins, and then does the same again, what was the benefit of his humbling himself? Who will heed his prayer

  Chapter 35.

    1: Whoever observes the law multiplies oblations
    2: It is a salutary sacrifice to attend to the commandments and to withdraw from all iniquity
    3: And to depart from injustice is to offer a propitiatory sacrifice for injustices and a supplication for sins
    4: Whoever gives thanks, offers a gift of fine flour, and whoever acts with mercy, offers a sacrifice
    5: To withdraw from iniquity is well-pleasing to the Lord. And to withdraw from injustice is a supplication for sins
    6: You should not appear empty before the sight of the Lord
    7: For all these things are to be done because of the commandment of God
    8: The oblation of the just fattens the altar, and is a fragrance of sweetness in the sight of the Most High
    9: The sacrifice of the just is acceptable, and the Lord will never forget the memorial of it
    10: Render glory to God with a good heart. And you should not reduce the first-fruits of your hands
    11: With every gift, have a cheerful countenance, and sanctify your tithes with exultation
    12: Give to the Most High according to his gifts to you, and act with a good eye toward the creations of your hands
    13: For the Lord gives recompense, and he will repay you seven times as much
    14: Do not be willing to offer corrupt gifts. For he will not accept them
    15: And do not be willing to consider an unjust sacrifice. For the Lord is the judge, and with him there is no favoritism toward anyone
    16: The Lord will not accept favoritism against the poor, but he will heed the prayer of one who has been harmed
    17: He will not despise the prayers of the orphan, nor of the widow, if she utters a lamenting complaint
    18: Do a widowâ€™s tears not run down her cheek? And will her outcry not cause their downfall
    19: For from her cheek, her tears ascend even to heaven. And the Lord, the One who listens, will not take delight in them
    20: Whoever adores God with joy will be accepted, and his prayer will reach even to the clouds
    21: The prayer of one who humbles himself will pierce the clouds. And it will not be consoled until it draws near; and it will not withdraw until the Most High beholds
    22: And the Lord will not delay, and he will judge for those who are just, and he will accomplish judgment. And the Almighty will not have patience with them, so that he may crush their back
    23: And he will repay vengeance to the Gentiles, until he has taken away the multitude of the arrogant, and broken the scepters of the iniquitous
    24: until he has rendered to men according to their deeds, and according to the works of Adam, and according to his presumption
    25: until he has judged the judgment of his people. And he will delight the just with his mercy
    26: The mercy of God is beautiful in the time of tribulation, like a rain cloud in the time of drought
