Day 276:

Reading 1-Maccabees, chapters ['1', '2', '3', '4']:

  Chapter 1.

    1: And it happened afterwards that Alexander, the son of Philip the Macedonian, who first reigned in Greece having come from the land of Kittim, struck Darius the king of the Persians and the Medes
    2: He appointed many battles, and he took hold of all the fortifications, and he executed the kings of the earth
    3: And he passed through even to the ends of the earth. And he received the spoils of many nations. And the earth was silenced in his sight
    4: And he gathered together power, and an exceedingly strong army. And he was exalted, and his heart was lifted up
    5: And he captured the regions of nations and of sovereign leaders, and they became tributaries to him
    6: And after these things, he fell down on his bed, and he knew that he would die
    7: And he called his servants, nobles who were raised with him from his youth. And he divided his kingdom to them, while he was still alive
    8: And Alexander reigned twelve years, and then he died
    9: And his servants obtained his kingdom, each one in his place
    10: And they all put diadems on themselves after his death, and their sons after them, for many years; and evils were multiplied on the earth
    11: And there went forth from among them a sinful root, Antiochus the illustrious, the son of king Antiochus, who had been a hostage at Rome. And he reigned in the one hundred and thirty-seventh year of the kingdom of the Greeks
    12: In those days, there went forth from Israel sons of iniquity, and they persuaded many, saying: “Let us go and negotiate a covenant with the Gentiles that are all around us. For since we have withdrawn from them, many evils have found us.
    13: And the word seemed good in their eyes
    14: And some of the people determined to do this, and they went to the king. And he gave them the power to act according to the justice of the Gentiles
    15: And they built a sports arena in Jerusalem, according to the laws of the Nations
    16: And they made themselves uncircumcised, and they withdrew from the holy covenant, and they were joined to the nations, and they were sold into evil-doing
    17: And the kingdom was ready in the sight of Antiochus, and he began to reign over the land of Egypt, so that he might reign over two kingdoms
    18: And he entered into Egypt with an oppressive multitude, with swift chariots, and elephants, and horsemen, and a great abundance of ships
    19: And he appointed a war against Ptolemy, the king of Egypt, and Ptolemy was filled with dread before his face, and he fled, and many fell down wounded
    20: And he took hold of the fortified cities in the land of Egypt, and he received the spoils of the land of Egypt
    21: And Antiochus turned back, after he struck Egypt, in the one hundred and forty-third year, and he ascended against Israel
    22: And he ascended to Jerusalem, with an oppressive multitude
    23: And he entered into the sanctuary with arrogance, and he took the golden altar, and the lampstand of light, and all the vessels, and the table for the bread of the Presence, and the vessels of libation, and the vials, and the little mortars of gold, and the veil, and the crowns, and the golden ornament, which was at the face of the temple. And he crushed them all
    24: And he took the silver and gold, and the precious vessels, and he took the hidden treasures, which he found. And having taken all these things away, he departed into his own land
    25: And he caused a massacre of men, and he was speaking with great arrogance
    26: And there was great wailing in Israel and in all of their places
    27: And the leaders and elders mourned, and the virgins and young men became weak, and the splendor of the women was changed
    28: Every bridegroom took up lamentation, and those who sat in the marriage bed mourned
    29: And the land shook on behalf of the inhabitants in it, and the entire house of Jacob was clothed with confusion
    30: And after two years of days, the king sent the prince of his tributes to the cities of Judah, and he came to Jerusalem with a great crowd
    31: And he spoke peaceful words to them, in deceitfulness; and they believed him
    32: And he rushed upon the city suddenly, and he struck it with a great scourging, and he destroyed many of the people of Israel
    33: And he took the spoils of the city, and he burned it with fire, and he destroyed its houses and the walls around it
    34: And they led away the women as captives, and they possessed the children and the cattle
    35: And they built up the city of David with a great and strong wall, and with strong towers, and it became a stronghold for them
    36: And they set up in that place a sinful people, wicked men, and together they grew strong in it. And they stored up weapons and provisions. And they gathered together the spoils of Jerusalem
    37: and deposited them in that place. And they became a great snare
    38: And this became a place of ambush against the sanctuary and a diabolical evil in Israel
    39: And they poured out innocent blood around the sanctuary, and they contaminated the sanctuary
    40: And the inhabitants of Jerusalem fled because of them, and the city became the dwelling place of outsiders, and she became a stranger to her own offspring, and her own children abandoned her
    41: Her sanctuary was desolate, like a place of solitude, her feast days were turned into mourning, her sabbaths into disgrace, her honors into nothing
    42: Her shame was multiplied according to her glory, and her loftiness was turned into lamentation
    43: And king Antiochus wrote to all his kingdom, that all the people must be one, and that each one should relinquish his own law
    44: And all Gentiles consented, according to the word of king Antiochus
    45: And many out of Israel consented to his servitude, and they sacrificed to idols, and they polluted the Sabbath
    46: And the king sent letters, by the hand of messengers, to Jerusalem and to all the cities of Judah: that they should follow the law of the Nations of the earth
    47: and that they should prohibit holocausts and sacrifices and atonements to be made in the temple of God
    48: and that they should prohibit the celebration of the Sabbath and the solemn days
    49: And he ordered the holy places to be defiled, along with the holy people of Israel
    50: “Grant us a pledge, and let the Jews cease from assailing us and the city.
    51: and that they should leave their sons uncircumcised, and defile their souls with all that is unclean, and with abominations, so that they would forget the law and would alter all the justifications of God
    52: and that whoever would not act according to the word of king Antiochus should be put to death
    53: According to all these words, he wrote to all his kingdom. And he appointed leaders over the people, who would compel them to do these things
    54: And these ordered the cities of Judah to sacrifice
    55: And many from the people, who had abandoned the law of the Lord, were gathered together by them. And they committed evils upon the land
    56: And they drove the people of Israel into hiding and into the secret places of fugitives
    57: On the fifteenth day of the month of Kislev, in the one hundred and forty-fifth year, king Antiochus set up the abominable idol of desolation on the altar of God, and they built altars throughout all the surrounding cities of Judah
    58: And they burned frankincense, and they sacrificed before the doors of houses and in the streets
    59: And they cut up the books of the law of God and destroyed them with fire
    60: And all those who were found with the books of the testament of the Lord, and whoever observed the law of the Lord, they butchered, according to the edict of the king
    61: By their power, they did these things to the people of Israel, as they were discovered in the cities, month after month
    62: And on the twenty-fifth day of the month, they sacrificed on that altar which was opposite the high altar
    63: And the women who circumcised their sons were butchered, according to the order of king Antiochus
    64: And they suspended the children by their necks in all their houses, and those who had circumcised them, they butchered
    65: And many of the people of Israel decided within themselves that they would not eat unclean things. And they chose to die, rather than to be defiled with unclean foods
    66: And they were not willing to infringe upon the holy law of God, and they were butchered
    67: And there was a very great wrath upon the people

  Chapter 2.

    1: In those days, there rose up Mattathias, the son of John, the son of Simeon, a priest of the sons of Joarib from Jerusalem, and he settled on the mountain of Modin
    2: And he had five sons: John, who was surnamed Gaddi
    3: and Simon, who was surnamed Thassi
    4: and Judas, who was called Maccabeus
    5: and Eleazar, who was surnamed Avaran, and Jonathan, who was surnamed Apphus
    6: These saw the evils that were done among the people of Judah and in Jerusalem
    7: And Mattathias said: “Woe to me, for why was I born to see the grief of my people and the grief of the holy city, and to sit there, while it is given into the hands of the enemies
    8: The holy places have fallen into the hands of outsiders. Her temple is like a man without honor
    9: The vessels of her glory have been taken away captive. Her old men have been butchered in the streets, and her young men have fallen by the sword of the enemies
    10: What nation has not inherited her kingdom and taken from her spoils
    11: All her beauty has been taken away. She who was free, has become a slave
    12: And behold, our sanctuary, and our beauty, and our splendor has been desolated, and the Gentiles have defiled them
    13: Therefore, what is it to us that we still live?
    14: And Mattathias and his sons tore their garments, and they covered themselves with haircloth, and they lamented greatly
    15: And those who had been sent from king Antiochus came to that place, to compel those who fled into the city of Modin to immolate, and to burn frankincense, and to depart from the law of God
    16: And many of the people of Israel consented and came to them. But Mattathias and his sons stood firm
    17: And those who had been sent from Antiochus, responding, said to Mattathias: “You are a ruler, and very splendid and great in this city, and you are adorned with sons and brothers
    18: Therefore, approach first, and carryout the order of the king, as all the nations have done, and the men of Judah, and those who remained in Jerusalem. And you and your sons will be among the friends of the king, and enriched with gold and silver and many gifts.
    19: And Mattathias responded, and he said with a loud voice: “Even if all nations obey king Antiochus, so that each one departs from the service of the law of his fathers and consents to his commandments
    20: I and my sons and my brothers will obey the law of our fathers
    21: May God be forgiving to us. It is not useful for us to abandon the law and the justices of God
    22: We will not listen to the words of king Antiochus, nor will we sacrifice, transgressing the commandments of our law, so as to set out on another way.
    23: And, as he ceased speaking these words, a certain Jew approached in the sight of all to sacrifice to the idols upon the altar in the city of Modin, according to the order of the king
    24: And Mattathias saw, and he grieved, and his temperament trembled, and his fury was enkindled according to the judgment of the law, and leaping up, he slaughtered him on the altar
    25: Moreover, the man whom king Antiochus had sent, who compelled them to immolate, he killed at the same time, and he destroyed the altar
    26: and he was zealous for the law, just as Phinehas did to Zimri, the son of Salomi
    27: And Mattathias exclaimed with a loud voice in the city, saying, “All who hold zeal for the law, maintaining the covenant, let them follow me.
    28: And he and his sons fled to the mountains, and they left behind whatever they had in the city
    29: Then many who sought judgment and justice went down into the desert
    30: And they camped there, with their sons, and their wives, and their herds, because evils had overwhelmed them
    31: And it was reported to the king’s men, and to the army that was in Jerusalem, in the city of David, that certain men, who had cast aside the commandment of the king, had departed into the hidden places in the desert, and that many had followed after them
    32: And immediately, they went out to them, and they arranged a battle against them, on the day of the Sabbath
    33: And they said to them: “And now, do you still resist? Go out and act according to the word of king Antiochus, and you will live.
    34: And they said, “We will not go out, and we will not do the king’s word, so as to profane the day of the Sabbath.
    35: And they rushed against them in battle
    36: But they did not respond, nor did they cast a stone at them, nor did they barricade the hidden places
    37: for they said, “Let us all die in our simplicity. And heaven and earth will testify for us, that you destroyed us unjustly.
    38: So they carried out a battle on the Sabbath. And they were put to death, with their wives, and their sons, and their cattle, even to the number of a thousand souls of men
    39: And Mattathias and his friends heard of it, and they held a very great lamentation for them
    40: And every man said to his neighbor, “If we all do just as our brothers have done, and if we do not fight against the Gentiles for the sake of our lives and our justifications, then they will quickly eradicate us from the earth.
    41: And they decided, on that day, saying: “Every man, who will come against us in warfare on the day of the Sabbath, we will fight against him. And we will not all die, like our brothers who were put to death in the hidden places.
    42: Then there was assembled before them the synagogue of the Hasideans, strong men from Israel, each one with a will for the law
    43: And all those who fled from the evils added themselves to them, and they became a firmament to them
    44: And they gathered together an army, and they struck down the sinners in their wrath and the wicked men in their indignation. And the others fled to the nations, so as to escape
    45: And Mattathias and his friends traveled around, and they destroyed the altars
    46: And they circumcised all the uncircumcised boys, whom they found within the limits of Israel, and they acted with fortitude
    47: And they pursued the sons of arrogance, and the work was prosperous in their hands
    48: And they obtained the law from the hands of the Gentiles, and from the hands of the kings. And they did not surrender the horn to the sinner
    49: Then the days drew near when Mattathias would die, and he said to his sons: “Now arrogance and chastisement have been strengthened, and it is a time of overturning and of the wrath of indignation
    50: Now therefore, O sons, be imitators of the law, and give your lives for the sake of the covenant of your fathers
    51: And call to mind the works of the fathers, which they have done in their generations. And you will receive great glory and an eternal name
    52: Was not Abraham found to be faithful in temptation, and so it was accounted to him as justice
    53: Joseph, in the time of his anguish, kept the commandment, and he was made ruler of Egypt
    54: Phinehas our father, being zealous in the zeal of God, received the covenant of an eternal priesthood
    55: Jesus, since he fulfilled the word, was made a commander in Israel
    56: Caleb, since he testified in the assembly, received an inheritance
    57: David, in his mercy, obtained the throne of a kingdom for all generations
    58: Elijah, since he was zealous with a zeal for the law, was received into heaven
    59: Hananiah and Azariah and Mishael, by believing, were delivered from the flame
    60: Daniel, in his simplicity, was delivered from the mouth of the lions
    61: And so, consider that, through generation after generation of all those who trusted in him, none have failed in strength
    62: And fear not the words of a sinful man, for his glory is dung and worms
    63: Today he is extolled, and tomorrow he will not be found, because he has returned into his earth and his thinking has perished
    64: Therefore, you sons, be strengthened and act manfully in the law. For by it, you shall become glorious
    65: And behold, I know that your brother Simon is a man of counsel. Heed him always, and he will be a father to you
    66: And Judas Maccabeus, who has been strong and resourceful from his youth, let him be the leader of your militia, and he will manage the war of the people
    67: And you shall add to yourselves all who observe the law, and you shall claim the vindication of your people
    68: Render to the Gentiles their retribution, and pay attention to the precepts of the law.
    69: And he blessed them, and he was added to his fathers
    70: And he passed away in the one hundred and forty-sixth year, and he was buried by his sons in the sepulchers of his fathers, in Modin, and all Israel mourned for him with a great mourning

  Chapter 3.

    1: And his son Judas, who was called Maccabeus, rose up in his place
    2: And all his brothers assisted him, along with all those who had joined themselves to his father. And they fought the battle of Israel with rejoicing
    3: And he expanded the glory of his people, and he clothed himself with a breastplate like a giant, and he surrounded himself his weapons of war in battles, and he protected the camp with his sword
    4: In his actions, he became like a lion, and like a young lion roaring in the hunt
    5: And he pursued the wicked and tracked them down. And those who disturbed his people, he burned with fire
    6: And his enemies were repelled by the fear of him, and all the workers of iniquity were troubled. And salvation was well-directed in his hand
    7: And he provoked many kings, and he gave joy to Jacob by his works, and his memory will be a blessing for all generations
    8: And he traveled through the cities of Judah, and he destroyed the impious out of them, and he turned wrath away from Israel
    9: And he was renowned, even to the utmost part of the earth, and he gathered together those who were perishing
    10: And so Apollonius gathered together the Gentiles, with a numerous and great army from Samaria, to make war against Israel
    11: And Judas knew about it, and he went forth to meet him. And he struck him and killed him. And many fell down wounded, and the rest fled away
    12: And he took away their spoils. And Judas took possession of the sword of Apollonius, and he fought with it during all his days
    13: And Seron, the leader of the army of Syria, heard that Judas had gathered together a company of the faithful and an assembly with him
    14: And he said, “I will make a name for myself, and I will be glorified in the kingdom, and I will defeat Judas in warfare, and those who are with him, who have spurned the word of the king.
    15: And he prepared himself. And the camp of the impious went up with him, with strong auxiliaries, so as to act with vengeance upon the sons of Israel
    16: And they approached even as far as Bethhoron. And Judas went forth to meet him, with a few men
    17: But when they saw the army coming to meet them, they said to Judas, “How will we few be able to fight against so great and so strong a multitude, even though we are weakened by fasting today?
    18: And Judas said: “It is easy for many to be enclosed in the hands of a few, for there is no difference in the sight of the God of heaven to liberate by means of many, or by means of few
    19: For victory in warfare is not in the multitude of the army, but in the strength from heaven
    20: They come to us with a contemptuous multitude and with arrogance, in order to destroy us, with our wives and our sons, and to despoil us
    21: In truth, we will fight on behalf of our souls and our laws
    22: And the Lord himself will crush them before our face. But as for you, do not fear them.
    23: And as soon as he had ceased speaking, he attacked them suddenly. And Seron and his army were crushed in his sight
    24: And he pursued him from the descent of Bethhoron, even to the plains. And eight hundred of their men were cut down, but the rest fled into the land of the Philistines
    25: And the fear and dread of Judas, as well as his brothers, fell upon all the nations around them
    26: And his name reached even to the king, and all the nations told stories of the battles of Judas
    27: But when king Antiochus heard these accounts, he was angry to his very soul. And he sent and gathered together forces from his entire kingdom, a very strong army
    28: And he opened his treasury, and he gave out stipends to the army for a year. And he commanded them to make ready for all things
    29: And he saw that the money from his treasures had failed, and that the tributes of the country were small, because of the dissension and the scourging that he had caused on earth in order to take away the legitimate laws, which had been since the first days
    30: And he feared, lest he not have enough the second time as the first, for expenses and gifts, which he had given before with a liberal hand. For his excesses were more than the kings who had been before him
    31: And he was alarmed to his very soul, and he intended to go into Persia, and to take tributes from the regions, and to gather together much money
    32: And he left behind Lysias, a nobleman of royal family, to preside over the kingdom from the river Euphrates, even to the river of Egypt
    33: and to raise his son, Antiochus, until he would return
    34: And he handed over to him half of the army, and the elephants. And he commanded him concerning all that he wanted, and concerning the inhabitants of Judea and Jerusalem
    35: so that he would send an army against them to crush and to root out the virtue of Israel and the remnant of Jerusalem, and to take away the memory of them from that place
    36: and so that he would establish dwelling places for the sons of foreigners in all their parts, and would distribute their land by lot
    37: And so, the king took the remaining part of the army, and he went forth from Antioch, the city of his kingdom, in the one hundred and forty-seventh year. And he crossed over the river Euphrates, and he traveled through the upper regions
    38: Then Lysias chose Ptolemy, the son of Dorymenes, and Nicanor and Gorgias, powerful men from among the king’s friends
    39: And he sent them with forty thousand men, and seven thousand horsemen, to enter into the land of Judah, and to destroy it, according to the word of the king
    40: And so, they proceeded with all their power, and they arrived and took a position near Emmaus, in the land of the plains
    41: And the merchants of the regions heard of their name. And they took very much silver, and gold, and servants, and they came into the camp to take the sons of Israel into servitude. And armies from Syria and from the lands of foreigners were added to them
    42: And Judas and his brothers saw that evils were being multiplied, and that armies had been positioned near their borders. And they knew the words of the king, which ordered the people to be put to death and to be utterly consumed
    43: And they said, each one to his neighbor, “Let us relieve the dejection of our people, and let us fight on behalf of our people and our sacred places.
    44: And an assembly was gathered together, so that they would be prepared for battle, and so that they could pray and ask for mercy and compassion
    45: Now Jerusalem was not inhabited, but was like a desert. There was no one who entered or exited from among her children. And the sanctuary was trampled upon, and the sons of foreigners were in the stronghold. This place was the habitation of the Gentiles. And delight was taken away from Jacob, and the music of flute and harp ceased in that place
    46: And they gathered together and came to Mizpah, opposite Jerusalem. For a place of prayer was in Mizpah, in the former Israel
    47: And they fasted on that day, and they clothed themselves with haircloth, and they placed ashes on their heads, and they tore their garments
    48: And they laid open the books of the law, in which the Gentiles searched for the likeness of their idols
    49: And they brought the priestly ornaments, and the first fruits and tithes, and they roused the Nazirites, who had fulfilled their days
    50: And they cried out with a loud voice toward heaven, saying: “What shall we do with these, and where shall we take them
    51: For your holy things have been trampled and defiled, and your priests have been in mourning and in humiliation
    52: And behold, the Nations gather together against us, to destroy us. You know what they intend against us
    53: How shall we be able to stand before their face, unless you, O God, assist us?
    54: Then they sounded the trumpets with a loud call
    55: And after this, Judas appointed commanders over the people: over thousands, and over hundreds, and over fifties, and over tens
    56: And he said to those who were building houses, or who had betrothed wives, who were planting vineyards, or who were terribly afraid, that they should return, each one to his own house, according to the law
    57: So they moved the camp, and relocated to the south of Emmaus
    58: And Judas said: “Gird yourselves, and be sons of power, and be ready in the morning, so that you may fight against these nations that have assembled against us, so as to destroy us and our sacred things
    59: For it is better for us to die in battle, than to see evils come to our nation and to the sacred places
    60: Nevertheless, as it shall be willed in heaven, so let it be.

  Chapter 4.

    1: Then Gorgias took five thousand men and a thousand chosen horsemen, and they moved out of the camp by night
    2: so that they might set upon the camp of the Jews and strike them suddenly. And the sons who were from the stronghold were their guides
    3: And Judas heard of it, and he rose up, with his powerful men, to strike the force from the king’s army that was in Emmaus
    4: For the army was still dispersed from the camp
    5: And Gorgias came by night, into the camp of Judas, and found no one, and he sought them in the mountains. For he said, “These men flee from us.
    6: And when it had become day, Judas appeared in the plain with only three thousand men, who had neither armor nor swords
    7: And they saw the strength of the camp of the Gentiles, and the men in armor, and the horsemen surrounding them, and that these were trained to fight
    8: And Judas said to the men who were with him: “Do not be afraid of their multitude, and do not dread their attack
    9: Remember in what way salvation came to our fathers in the Red Sea, when Pharaoh pursued them with a great army
    10: And now, let us cry out to heaven, and the Lord will have mercy on us, and he will remember the covenant of our fathers, and he will crush this army before our face this day
    11: And all nations shall know that there is One who redeems and frees Israel.
    12: And the foreigners lifted up their eyes, and they saw them coming against them
    13: And they went out of the camp into battle, and those who were with Judas sounded the trumpet
    14: And they came together. And the Gentiles were crushed, and they fled into the plains
    15: But the last of them all fell by the sword, and they pursued them even to Gazara, and even to the plains of Idumea, and Azotus, and Jamnia. And there fell from them as many as three thousand men
    16: And Judas returned, with his army following him
    17: And he said to the people: “Do not desire the spoils; for there is war before us
    18: And Gorgias and his army are near us on the mountain. But stand firm now against our enemies, and fight against them, and you shall take the spoils afterwards, securely.
    19: And while Judas was speaking these words, behold, a certain part of them appeared, looking out from the mountain
    20: And Gorgias saw that his men were put to flight, and that they had set fire to the camp. For the smoke that he saw declared what had happened
    21: When they had seen this, they became very afraid, seeing at the same time both Judas and his army in the plains prepared to do battle
    22: So they all fled away into the encampment of the foreigners
    23: And Judas returned to take the spoils of the camp, and they obtained much gold and silver, and hyacinth, and purple of the sea, and great riches
    24: And returning, they sang a canticle, and they blessed God in heaven, because he is good, because his mercy is with every generation
    25: And so, a great salvation occurred in Israel in that day
    26: But those among the foreigners who escaped went and reported to Lysias all that had happened
    27: And when he heard these things, he was discouraged, being alarmed to his very soul. For things had not occurred in Israel according to his wishes, nor as the king had commanded
    28: And, in the following year, Lysias gathered together sixty thousand chosen men and five thousand horsemen, so that he might defeat them in warfare
    29: And they came into Judea, and they positioned their camp in Bethzur, and Judas met them with ten thousand men
