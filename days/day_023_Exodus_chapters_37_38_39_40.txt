Day 23:

Reading Exodus, chapters ['37', '38', '39', '40']:

  Chapter 37.

    1: Now Bezalel also made the ark from setim wood, having two and one half cubits in length, and one and one half cubits in width, and the height was also one and one half cubits. And he clothed it with the purest gold, inside and out
    2: And for it he made a crown of gold all around
    3: casting four gold rings at its four corners: two rings on one side, and two on the other
    4: Likewise, he made bars from setim wood, which he clothed with gold
    5: and he placed them into the rings, which were at the sides of the ark, to carry it
    6: He also made the propitiatory, that is, the oracle, from the finest gold, two and one half cubits in length, and one and one half cubits in width
    7: and then two Cherubim of ductile gold, which he positioned at the two sides of the propitiatory
    8: one Cherub at the top of one side, and the other Cherub at the top of the other side. The two Cherubim were at each end of the propitiatory
    9: spreading their wings, and protecting the propitiatory, and gazing toward it and toward one another
    10: He also made the table from setim wood, with a length of two cubits, and a width of one cubit, which had a height of one and one half cubits
    11: And he surrounded it with the finest gold, and for it he made a ledge of gold all around
    12: and for the ledge itself he made a polished crown of gold, four fingers high, and upon the same, another crown of gold
    13: And he cast four gold rings, which he set at the four corners at each foot of the table
    14: opposite the crown. And he placed the bars into them, so that the table could be carried
    15: Likewise, the bars themselves he made from setim wood, and he surrounded them with gold
    16: And he made vessels for the diverse uses of the table, as well as the little cups, and bowls, and measuring cups, and the censers, from pure gold, in which the libations would be offered
    17: He also made the lampstand, formed from the finest gold. The branches, bowls, and little spheres, as well as the lilies, proceeded from its bar
    18: six on the two sides, three branches on one side, and three on the other
    19: Three bowls, the size of a nut, were on each branch, with little spheres and lilies, and three bowls, in the likeness of a nut, were on the other branch, with the little spheres together with the lilies. The workmanship of the six branches, which proceeded from the shaft of the lampstand, was equal
    20: Now on the shaft itself were four bowls, the size of a nut, and little spheres together with each one, and lilies
    21: and little spheres under two branches in three places, which together made six branches proceeding from one bar
    22: Thus, both the little spheres and the branches were from the same thing: all hand-worked from the purest gold
    23: He also made the seven lamps with their candle snuffers, and the vessels where the candles would be extinguished, from the finest gold
    24: The lampstand with all its vessels weighed a talent of gold
    25: He also made the altar of incense from setim wood, having one cubit on each of four sides, and in height, two. From its corners proceeded horns
    26: And he clothed it with the purest gold, with its grating, as well as the sides and the horns
    27: And for it he made a crown of gold all around, and two gold rings under the crown at each side, so that the bars might be put into them, and the altar could be carried
    28: Now the bars themselves he also made from setim wood, and he covered them with layers of gold
    29: He also composed the oil for the ointment of sanctification, and the incense, from the purest aromatics, with the skill of a perfumer

  Chapter 38.

    1: He also made the altar of holocaust from setim wood: five cubits square, and three in height
    2: the horns of which proceeded from the corners. And he covered it with layers of brass
    3: And for its uses, he prepared diverse vessels out of brass: kettles, forceps, little hooks, larger hooks, and receptacles for the fire
    4: And he made its grating of brass, in the manner of a net, and under it, in the midst of the altar, its base
    5: casting four rings at the four ends of the net in order to set the bars, so as to carry it
    6: These bars he also made of setim wood, and he covered them with layers of brass
    7: And he drew them through the rings, which projected from the sides of the altar. But the altar itself was not solid, but hollow, made from panels and empty inside
    8: He also made the washtub of brass, with its base made from the mirrors of the women who kept watch at the door of the tabernacle
    9: He also made the atrium, at the south side of which were hangings of fine twisted linen of one hundred cubits an
    10: twenty columns of brass with their bases. The heads of the columns and all of the engraving work were of silver
    11: Equally, at the northern area, the hangings, the columns, and the bases and heads of the columns were of the same measure and work and metal
    12: Yet truly, on that side which looks out toward the west, there were hangings of fifty cubits, and ten columns with their bases of brass. And the heads of the columns and all of the engraving work were of silver
    13: Furthermore, toward the east, he prepared hangings of fifty cubits
    14: of which, there were fifteen cubits, among three columns with their bases, holding up one side
    15: and on the other side, (for between the two he made the entrance of the tabernacle) there were equally hangings of fifteen cubits, and three pillars, and the same number of bases
    16: All the hangings of the atrium were woven from fine twisted linen.
    17: The bases of the columns were of brass, but their heads with all of their engravings were of silver. Now he also overlaid the columns of the atrium themselves with silver
    18: And he made, at its entrance, a hanging, wrought with embroidery, of hyacinth, purple, vermillion, and fine twisted linen, which held twenty cubits in length, yet truly it was five cubits in height, as with the measure of all the hangings of the atrium
    19: Now the columns at the entrance were four, with bases of brass, and their heads and engravings were of silver
    20: Likewise, the tent pegs of the tabernacle and the atrium all around he made of brass
    21: These are the instruments of the tabernacle of the testimony, which were enumerated according to the instruction of Moses, with the ceremonies of the Levites, by the hand of Ithamar, the son of Aaron the priest
    22: which Bezalel, the son of Uri, the son of Hur from the tribe of Judah, had completed, just as the Lord decreed through Moses
    23: He was joined by his associate, Oholiab, the son of Ahisamach, from the tribe of Dan, who himself was also an exceptional artisan of wood, and of weaving, as well as of embroidery, with hyacinth, purple, vermillion, and fine linen
    24: All of the gold that was expended in the work of the Sanctuary, and that was offered in donation, was twenty-nine talents and seven hundred thirty shekels, according to the measure of the Sanctuary
    25: Now it was offered by those who were past the numbering of twenty years and above: from six hundred and three thousand, five hundred and fifty men able to bear arms
    26: There were, beyond that, one hundred talents of silver, from which were cast the bases for the Sanctuary and for the entrance where the veil hangs
    27: One hundred bases were made from one hundred talents, a single talent being counted for each base
    28: But from one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five, he made the heads of the columns, which he also clothed with silver
    29: Likewise, of brass, there was offered seventy-two thousand talents, and four hundred more shekels
    30: from which were cast the bases at the entrance of the tabernacle of the testimony, and the altar of brass with its grating, and the vessels which pertain to its use
    31: and the bases of the atrium, as much at the circumference as at its entrance, and the tent pegs of the tabernacle and of the atrium all round

  Chapter 39.

    1: Truly, from hyacinth and purple, vermillion and fine linen, he made the vestments with which Aaron was clothed when he ministered in the holy places, just as the Lord instructed Moses
    2: And so he made an ephod of gold, hyacinth, and purple, and twice-dyed scarlet, and fine twisted linen
    3: wrought with embroidery. And he cut thin strips of gold and drew them into threads, so that they could be twisted into the weave of the first colors
    4: And he made two edges, coupled to one another at the top of both sides
    5: and a wide belt from the same colors, just as the Lord had instructed Moses
    6: He also prepared two onyx stones, set and enclosed in gold, and engraved with the skill of a jeweler, with the names of the sons of Israel
    7: And he set them in the sides of the ephod, as a memorial to the sons of Israel, just as the Lord had instructed Moses
    8: He also made a breastplate, wrought with embroidery, according to the work of the ephod, from gold, hyacinth, purple, and twice-dyed scarlet, and fine twisted linen
    9: with four equal sides, doubled, of the measure of the palm of a hand
    10: And he set four rows of gems in it. In the first row was a sardius stone, a topaz, an emerald
    11: in the second was a garnet, a sapphire, and a jasper
    12: in the third was a zircon, an agate, and an amethyst
    13: in the fourth was a chrysolite, an onyx, and a beryl, surrounded and enclosed in gold by their rows
    14: And these twelve stones were engraved with the names of the twelve tribes of Israel, each one with a single name
    15: They also made, in the breastplate, little chains linked to one another, from the purest gold
    16: and two hooks, and the same number of gold rings. Moreover, they set the rings at both sides of the breastplate
    17: from which two golden chains would hang, which they connected with the hooks that projected from the corners of the ephod
    18: These were both in front and in back so that they met one another, and so that the ephod and the breastplate were woven together
    19: being fastened to the wide belt and strongly coupled with rings, to which a hyacinth band was joined, lest they should shake loose and be moved away from one another, just as the Lord instructed Moses
    20: They also made the tunic of the ephod entirely from hyacinth
    21: with the head in the upper part at the middle, and a woven edge all around the head
    22: Then, at the feet below, they also made pomegranates from hyacinth, purple, vermillion, and fine twisted linen
    23: and little bells from the purest gold, which they set between the pomegranates at the very bottom of the tunic all around
    24: So then, the high priest approached, adorned with gold bell and pomegranate, when he performed his ministry, just as the Lord had instructed Moses
    25: They also made fine linen tunics with woven work, for Aaron and his sons
    26: and headdresses with their little crowns of fine linen
    27: and also linen undergarments of fine linen
    28: Truly, they also made a wide band of fine twisted linen, hyacinth, purple, as well as vermillion, twice-dyed, with skillful embroidery, just as the Lord had instructed Moses
    29: They also made the plate of sacred veneration from the purest gold, and they wrote on it, with the skill of a jeweler: “Holy to the Lord.
    30: And they fastened it to the headdress with a hyacinth band, just as the Lord had instructed Moses
    31: And so all the work of the tabernacle and of the covering of the testimony was completed. And the sons of Israel did all that the Lord had instructed Moses
    32: And they offered the tabernacle, and the covering, and all of the articles: the rings, the panels, the bars, the columns and bases
    33: the cover of the skins of rams, dyed red, and the other cover of violet skins
    34: the veil, the ark, the bars, the propitiatory
    35: the table, with its vessels and the bread of the presence
    36: the lampstand, the lamps, and their utensils with the oil
    37: the altar of gold, and the ointment, and the incense of aromatics
    38: and the tent at the entrance of the tabernacle
    39: the altar of brass, the grating, the bars, and all of its vessels, the washtub with its base, the hangings of the atrium, and the columns with their bases
    40: the hanging at the entrance of the atrium, and their little cords and pegs. Nothing was lacking of the articles that were commanded to be made for the ministry of the tabernacle and for the covering of the covenant
    41: Likewise, the vestments, which the priests, namely, Aaron and his sons, make use of use in the Sanctuary
    42: the sons of Israel offered, just as the Lord had instructed
    43: After this, when Moses saw that everything was completed, he blessed them

  Chapter 40.

    1: And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying
    2: “In the first month, on the first day of the month, you shall raise the tabernacle of the testimony
    3: and you shall place the ark in it, and you shall release the veil before it
    4: And having brought in the table, you shall place the things which were solemnly commanded upon it. The lampstand shall stand with its lamps
    5: and the altar of gold, in which the incense is burned, shall stand before the ark of the testimony. You shall place the tent at the entrance of the tabernacle
    6: and before it, the altar of holocaust
    7: The washtub shall stand between the altar and the tabernacle, and you shall fill it with water
    8: And you shall encompass the atrium and its entrance with hangings
    9: And, having taken up the oil of unction, you shall anoint the tabernacle along with its articles, so that they may be sanctified
    10: The altar of holocaust and all its vessels
    11: the washtub with its base, and all things, you shall consecrate with the oil of unction, so that they may be the Holy of holies
    12: And you shall bring forward Aaron and his sons to the entrance of the tabernacle of the testimony, and, having washed them with water
    13: you shall clothe them in the holy vestments, so that they may minister to me, and so that their unction may accomplish an everlasting priesthood.
    14: And Moses did all that the Lord had instructed
    15: Therefore, in the first month of the second year, on the first day of the month, the tabernacle was put in place
    16: And Moses raised it up, and he positioned the panels as well as the bases and the bars, and he set up the columns
    17: and he stretched out the roof over the tabernacle, imposing a cover above it, just as the Lord had decreed
    18: And he placed the testimony in the ark, applying the bars beneath, and the oracle above
    19: And when he had brought the ark into the tabernacle, he drew the veil before it, in order to fulfill the commandment of the Lord
    20: And he placed the table in the tabernacle of the testimony, at the north side, beyond the veil
    21: arranging before it the bread of the presence, just as the Lord had instructed Moses
    22: And he placed the lampstand in the tabernacle of the testimony, away from the table, on the south side
    23: setting the lamps in order, according to the precept of the Lord
    24: He also positioned the altar of gold under the roof of the testimony, opposite the veil
    25: and he heaped upon it the incense of aromatics, just as the Lord had commanded Moses
    26: And he positioned the tent at the entrance of the tabernacle of the testimony
    27: and the altar of holocaust in the vestibule of the testimony, offering the holocaust and the sacrifices upon it, just as the Lord had decreed
    28: Likewise, he stationed the washtub between the tabernacle of the testimony and the altar, filling it with water
    29: And Moses and Aaron, along with his sons, washed their hands and feet
    30: whenever they would enter the covering of the covenant, and when they approached to the altar, just as the Lord had instructed Moses
    31: And he raised up the atrium around the tabernacle and the altar, drawing the hanging at its entrance. After all these things were perfected
    32: the cloud covered the tabernacle of the testimony, and the glory of the Lord filled it
    33: Neither could Moses enter the covering of the covenant: the cloud was covering all things, and the majesty of the Lord was flashing. For the cloud had covered everything
    34: Whenever the cloud departed from the tabernacle, the sons of Israel set out by their companies
    35: But if it remained hanging over it, they remained in the same place
    36: Certainly, the cloud of the Lord lay over the tabernacle by day, and the fire by night, being seen by all the people of Israel throughout all their resting places
