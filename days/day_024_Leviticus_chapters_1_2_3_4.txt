Day 24:

Reading Leviticus, chapters ['1', '2', '3', '4']:

  Chapter 1.

    1: Then the Lord called Moses and spoke to him from the tabernacle of the testimony, saying
    2: Speak to the sons of Israel, and you shall say to them: The man among you who will offer to the Lord a sacrifice from the cattle, that is, an offering of victims of oxen or sheep
    3: if his offering will be a holocaust, as well as from the herd, he shall offer an immaculate male at the door of the tabernacle of the testimony, to make himself pleasing to the Lord
    4: And he shall place his hand on the head of the sacrifice, and so it shall be acceptable and effective, in its expiation
    5: And he shall immolate the calf in the sight of the Lord. And the priests, the sons of Aaron, shall offer its blood, pouring it all around the altar, which is before the door of the tabernacle
    6: And having pulled away the skin of the victim, they shall cut up the joints into pieces
    7: and they shall toss fire under the altar, having arranged beforehand a stack of wood
    8: And they shall lay the parts which are cut up in order upon it: namely, the head, and all the things that adjoin to the liver
    9: the intestines and feet having been washed with water. And the priest shall burn them on the altar as a holocaust and as a sweet odor to the Lord
    10: But if the offering is from the flocks, a holocaust either of sheep or goats, he shall offer a male without blemish
    11: And he shall immolate it at the side of the altar which looks out toward the north, in the sight of the Lord. Yet truly, the sons of Aaron shall pour its blood upon the altar all around
    12: And they shall divide the limbs, the head, and everything that adjoins to the liver. And they shall place them on the wood, under which the fire is to be thrown
    13: Yet truly, the intestines and the feet they shall wash with water. And the priest, having offered everything, shall burn it upon the altar as a holocaust and as a most sweet odor to the Lord
    14: But if the oblation of a holocaust to the Lord is of birds, either of turtledoves, or young pigeons
    15: the priest shall offer it at the altar: and twisting back the neck with the head, and also rupturing the place of the wound, he shall make the blood run down over the edge of the altar
    16: Yet truly, the craw of the throat and the feathers he shall cast near the altar at the eastern section, in the place where the ashes are usually poured out
    17: And he shall break its wing joints, but he shall neither cut, nor divide it with metal, and he shall burn it upon the altar, placing fire under the wood. It is a holocaust and an oblation of a most sweet odor to the Lord

  Chapter 2.

    1: When a soul will offer an oblation of sacrifice to the Lord, his oblation shall be of fine wheat flour, and he shall pour oil over it, and he shall set down frankincense
    2: and he shall bring it to the sons of Aaron, the priests. One of them shall take a handful of the flour with oil, as well as all the frankincense, and he shall place it as a memorial upon the altar, as a most sweet odor to the Lord
    3: Then what will remain of the sacrifice shall be for Aaron and his sons, the Holy of holies from the oblations of the Lord
    4: But when you will offer a sacrifice baked in the oven from fine wheat flour, specifically: loaves without leaven, sprinkled with oil, and unleavened wafers, rubbed with oil
    5: if your oblation will be from the frying pan, of flour tempered with oil and without leaven
    6: you shall divide it into little pieces and pour oil over it
    7: But if the sacrifice will be from the oven grating, equally the fine wheat flour shall be sprinkled with oil
    8: When you are offering it to the Lord, you shall deliver it into the hands of the priest
    9: And when he has offered it, he shall take a memorial from the sacrifice and burn it upon the altar as a sweet odor to the Lord
    10: But whatever is left shall be for Aaron and his sons, the Holy of holies from the oblations of the Lord
    11: Every oblation that is offered to the Lord shall be made without leaven; neither shall any leaven or honey be burned with the sacrifice to the Lord
    12: You shall offer only the first-fruits of these along with the gifts. Yet truly, these shall not be placed upon the altar as an odor of sweetness
    13: Whatever sacrifice you will offer, you shall season it with salt; neither shall you take away the salt of the covenant of your God from your sacrifice. In all your oblations, you shall offer salt
    14: But if you will offer a gift of the first-fruits of your grain to the Lord, from ears of grain still green, you shall parch it at the fire, and break it open in the manner of meal. And so shall you offer your first-fruits to the Lord
    15: pouring oil over it, and imposing frankincense, because it is an oblation of the Lord
    16: From this, the priest shall burn, as a memorial of the gift, a portion of the cracked grain and the oil, as well as all of the frankincense

  Chapter 3.

    1: But if his oblation will be a sacrifice of peace offerings, and he wishes to offer it from the oxen, whether male or female, he shall offer what is immaculate, in the sight of the Lord
    2: And he shall place his hand upon the head of his victim, which shall be immolated at the entrance of the tabernacle of the testimony. And the sons of Aaron, the priests, shall pour the blood all around the altar
    3: And they shall offer from the sacrifice of peace offerings, as an oblation to the Lord: the fat which covers the vital organs, and whatever fat is interior
    4: the two kidneys with the fat that covers the sides, and the mesh of the liver with the two little kidneys
    5: And they shall burn them upon the altar as a holocaust, placing fire under the wood, as an oblation of a most sweet odor to the Lord
    6: Yet truly, if his oblation and the sacrifice of peace offerings will be from the sheep, whether he will offer a male or a female, they shall be immaculate
    7: If he will offer a lamb in the sight of the Lord
    8: he shall place his hand upon the head of the victim. And it shall be immolated at the vestibule of the tabernacle of the testimony. And the sons of Aaron shall pour its blood all around the altar
    9: And they shall offer from the victim of peace offerings, as a sacrifice to the Lord: the fat, and the entire rum
    10: with the kidneys, and the fat that covers the abdomen, and all the vital organs, and both the little kidneys with the fat that is near the sides, and the mesh of the liver with the little kidneys
    11: And the priest shall burn them upon the altar, as fuel for the fire and as an oblation of the Lord
    12: If his oblation will be a goat, and he will offer it to the Lord
    13: he shall place his hand upon its head, and he shall immolate it at the entrance of the tabernacle of the testimony. And the sons of Aaron shall pour its blood all around the altar
    14: And they shall take from it, to feed the Lordâ€™s fire: the fat which covers the abdomen, and that which covers all the vital organs
    15: the two little kidneys with the mesh that is over them near the sides, and the fat of the liver with the little kidneys
    16: And the priest shall burn them upon the altar, as nourishment for the fire and as a most sweet odor. All the fat shall be for the Lord
    17: by a perpetual law, in your generations and in all of your habitations, neither blood nor fat shall you eat at all

  Chapter 4.

    1: And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying
    2: Say to the sons of Israel: The soul which will have sinned through ignorance, and concerning any of the commandments of the Lord that he instructed not to be done, if anything at all has been done
    3: if the priest, who is anointed, will have sinned, causing the people to commit a transgression, he shall offer to the Lord for his sin an immaculate calf
    4: And he shall lead it to the door of the tabernacle of the testimony in the sight of the Lord. And he shall place his hand upon its head, and he shall immolate it to the Lord
    5: Likewise, he shall take from the blood of the calf, carrying it into the tabernacle of the testimony
    6: and having dipped his finger into the blood, he shall sprinkle it seven times in the sight of the Lord, opposite the veil of the Sanctuary
    7: And he shall place some of the same blood over the horns of the altar of most pleasing incense to the Lord, which is in the tabernacle of the testimony. Then he shall pour out the remainder of the blood at the base of the altar of holocaust at the entrance of the tabernacle
    8: And, on behalf of the sin, he shall take the fat of the calf, both that which covers the vital organs and all that is interior
    9: the two little kidneys, and the mesh that is on them near the sides, and the fat of the liver with the little kidneys
    10: just as it is taken from the calf of the sacrifice of peace offerings. And he shall burn them upon the altar of holocaust
    11: Yet truly, the skin and all the flesh, with the head and the feet, and the intestines and the dung
    12: and the remainder of the body, he shall carry away, beyond the camp, to the clean place where the ashes are usually poured out. And he shall burn them upon a stack of wood. There, in the place where the ashes have been poured out, they will be burned
    13: But if all the crowd of Israel will have been ignorant, and through inexperience will have done what is contrary to the commandment of the Lord
    14: and afterwards shall understand their sin: they shall offer a calf on behalf of their sin, and they shall lead it to the door of the tabernacle
    15: And the elders of the people shall place their hands upon its head in the sight of the Lord. And when the calf has been immolated in the sight of the Lord
    16: the priest who is anointed shall carry some of its blood into the tabernacle of the testimony
    17: and he shall dip his finger in it, sprinkling it seven times opposite the veil
    18: And he shall place some of the same blood on the horns of the altar, which is in the presence of the Lord in the tabernacle of the testimony. But the remainder of the blood he shall pour out at the base of the altar of holocaust, which is at the door of the tabernacle of the testimony
    19: And he shall take all its fat and burn it upon the altar
    20: doing so with this calf in the same manner as he did before. And while the priest is praying for them, the Lord will forgive them
    21: But the calf itself he shall carry away, beyond the camp, and he shall also burn it, just as with the previous calf, because it is for the sin of the multitude
    22: If a leader will have sinned, and through ignorance will have done one of the many things which the law of the Lord prohibits
    23: and afterwards he shall understand his sin: he shall offer an immaculate he-goat from among the goats, as a sacrifice to the Lord
    24: And he shall place his hand upon its head. And when he will have immolated it, in the place where the holocaust is usually slain, in the sight of the Lord, because it is for sin
    25: the priest shall dip his finger in the blood of the victim for sin, touching the horns of the altar of holocaust, and pouring out the remainder at its base
    26: Yet truly, the fat he shall burn upon it, just as is usually done with the victims of peace offerings. And the priest shall pray for him and for his sin, and he shall be released from it
    27: But if a soul from the people of the land will have sinned through ignorance, so as to have done any of those things that the law of the Lord prohibits, and so commit a transgression
    28: and he shall realize his sin: he shall offer an immaculate she-goat
    29: And he shall place his hand upon the head of the victim which is for sin. And he shall immolate it in the place of the holocaust
    30: And the priest shall take some of the blood with his finger, and touching the horns of the altar of holocaust, he shall pour out the remainder at its base
    31: But taking away all the fat, just as it is usually taken away from the victims of peace offerings, he shall burn it upon the altar as a sweet odor to the Lord. And he shall pray for him, and he shall be released from it
    32: But if instead he will offer from the flock a victim for his sin, specifically, an immaculate female sheep
    33: he shall place his hand upon its head, and he shall immolate it in the place where the victims of holocausts are usually slain
    34: And the priest shall take some of its blood with his finger, and touching the horns of the altar of holocaust, he shall pour out the remainder at its base
    35: Likewise, all of the fat shall be taken away, just as the fat of the ram, which is immolated for peace offerings, is usually taken away. And he shall burn it upon the altar as an incense of the Lord. And he shall pray for him and for his sin, and he shall be released from it
