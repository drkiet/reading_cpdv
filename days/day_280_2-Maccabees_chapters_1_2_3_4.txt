Day 280:

Reading 2-Maccabees, chapters ['1', '2', '3', '4']:

  Chapter 1.

    1: To the brothers, the Jews, who are throughout Egypt: the brothers, the Jews, who are in Jerusalem and in the region of Judea, send greetings and good peace
    2: May God be gracious to you, and may he remember his covenant, which was spoken to Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, his faithful servants
    3: And may he give all of you the heart to worship him, and to do his will, with a great heart and a willing soul
    4: May he throw open your heart with his law and with his precepts, and may he create peace
    5: May he heed your prayers and be reconciled to you, and may he not forsake you in the evil time
    6: And now, in this place, we are praying for you
    7: When Demetrius reigned, in the one hundred and sixty-ninth year, we Jews wrote to you during the tribulation and assaults which overcame us in those years, from the time that Jason withdrew from the holy land and from the kingdom
    8: They burnt the gate, and they shed innocent blood. And we prayed to the Lord and were heard, and we brought forth sacrifices and fine wheat flour, and we kindled the lamps and set forth the loaves
    9: And now, celebrate the days of shelters in the month of Kislev
    10: In the one hundred and eighty-eighth year, from the people who are at Jerusalem and in Judea, and from the Senate and Judas: to Aristobulus, the magistrate of king Ptolemy, who is of the ancestry of anointed priests, and to those Jews who are in Egypt: greetings and good health
    11: Having been freed by God from great peril, we give thanks to him greatly, in as much as we have been struggling against so great a king
    12: For he caused those who fought against us and against the holy city to burst forth from Persia
    13: For when the commander himself was in Persia, and with him an immense army, he fell in the temple of Nanea, having been deceived by the counsel of the priests of Nanea
    14: For Antiochus also came to the place with his friends, as if to live with her, and so that he would receive much money in the name of a dowry
    15: And when the priests of Nanea had made the proposal, and he had entered with a few men into the vestibule of the shrine, they closed the temple
    16: after Antiochus had entered. And throwing open a hidden entrance to the temple, they cast stones, and they struck the leader and those who were with him. And, having severed their limbs and cut off their heads, they threw them outside
    17: Blessed be God through all things, who has delivered up the impious
    18: Therefore, establishing the purification of the temple on the twenty-fifth day of the month of Kislev, we considered it necessary to signify this to you, so that you, likewise, may keep the day of shelters, and the day of the fire that was given when Nehemiah offered sacrifice, after the temple and the altar had been built
    19: For when our fathers were led into Persia, the priests, who at that time were worshippers of God, secretly took the fire from the altar, and they kept it hidden in a valley, where there was a deep and dry pit, and they kept it safe in that place, in such a way that the place would be unknown to all
    20: But when many years had passed, and it pleased God that Nehemiah should be sent by the king of Persia, he sent some of the posterity of those priests who had hidden it to seek the fire. And, just as they told us, they did not find fire, but only deep water
    21: Then he ordered them to draw it up and to carry it to him. And the priest, Nehemiah, ordered the sacrifices, which had been set out, to be sprinkled with the same water, both the wood and those things that were placed on it
    22: And when this was done, and the time came when the sun shined brightly, which before was in a cloud, there was kindled a great fire, so much so that all were filled with wonder
    23: But all the priests were reciting prayer, while the sacrifice was being consumed, with Jonathan beginning and the rest answering
    24: And the prayer of Nehemiah was held in this way: “O Lord God, Creator of all, terrible and strong, just and merciful, you alone are the good King
    25: You alone are excellent, you alone are just, and all-powerful, and eternal, who frees Israel from all evil, who created the chosen fathers and sanctified them
    26: Receive the sacrifice on behalf of all of your people Israel, and preserve and sanctify your portion
    27: Gather together our dispersion, free those who are in servitude to the Gentiles, and respect those who are despised and abhorred, so that the Gentiles may know that you are our God
    28: Afflict those who, in their arrogance, are oppressing us and treating us abusively
    29: Establish your people in your holy place, just as Moses said.
    30: And so the priests sang hymns until the sacrifice had been consumed
    31: But when the sacrifice had been consumed, Nehemiah ordered the remainder of the water to be poured upon the great stones
    32: When this had been done, a flame was kindled from them, but it was consumed by the light that shined brightly from the altar
    33: In truth, when this thing became known, it was reported to the king of Persia that in the place where the fire had been hidden by those priests who had been led away, water appeared, by which Nehemiah, and those who were with him, purified the sacrifices
    34: But the king, considering and examining the matter diligently, made a temple for it, so that he might study what had happened
    35: And when he had studied it, he gave the priests many goods and presents, of one kind or another, and using his own hands, he distributed these
    36: And Nehemiah called this place Nephthar, which is interpreted as Purification. But with many it is called Nephi

  Chapter 2.

    1: Now it is found in the descriptions of the prophet Jeremiah that he ordered those who transmigrated to take the fire, just as it was signified and as he ordered, into the transmigration
    2: And he gave them the law, so that they would never forget the commandments of the Lord, and so that they would not go astray in their minds, seeing the idols of gold and silver, and their ornaments
    3: And in this manner, with other sayings, he exhorted them, lest they remove the law from their heart
    4: Furthermore, it was in the same writing, how the prophet, by divine response, ordered that the tabernacle and the ark be made to accompany him, until he exited from the mountain, where Moses ascended and saw the inheritance of God
    5: And arriving there, Jeremiah found a place in a cave. And he brought both the tabernacle, and the ark, and the altar of incense into that place, and he obstructed opening
    6: And certain ones of those who followed him, approached to make note of the location, but they were not able to find it
    7: But when Jeremiah knew of it, he blamed them, saying: “The place shall be unknown, until God shall gather together the congregation of the people, and until he may be favorably inclined
    8: And then the Lord will reveal these things, and the majesty of the Lord shall appear, and there will be a cloud, just as it was also manifested to Moses, and just as he manifested these when Solomon petitioned that the place should be sanctified to the great God
    9: For he also drew upon wisdom magnificently, and so, having wisdom, he offered the sacrifice of the dedication and the consummation of the temple
    10: And, just as Moses prayed to the Lord, and fire descended from heaven and consumed the holocaust, so also Solomon prayed and fire descended from heaven and consumed the holocaust
    11: And Moses said that it was consumed because the sin offering was not eaten
    12: And similarly, Solomon also celebrated the eight days of the dedication
    13: Moreover, these same things were put into the descriptions and commentaries of Nehemiah, including how, when constructing a library, he gathered together from the regions the books of the Prophets, and of David, and the epistles of the kings, and from the holy gifts
    14: And, similarly, Judas also gathered together all the things that were destroyed by the war that befell us, and these are with us
    15: Therefore, if you desire these things, send those who may carry them to you
    16: And so, since we will be celebrating the purification, we wrote to you. Therefore, you will do well, if you keep these days
    17: But we hope that God, who has freed his people and has rendered to all the inheritance, and the kingdom, and the priesthood, and sanctification
    18: just as he promised in the law, will quickly have mercy on us and will gather us together from under heaven into the holy place
    19: For he has rescued us from great perils, and he has purged the place
    20: The truth about Judas Maccabeus, and his brothers, and the purification of the great temple, and the dedication of the altar
    21: and also about the battles, which pertain to Antiochus the illustrious, and his son, Eupator
    22: and about the illuminations, which came from heaven to those who acted on behalf of the Jews with fortitude, was such that they, though few, vindicated the entire region and put to flight a multitude of the barbarous
    23: and recovered the most famous temple in the whole world, and freed the city, and restored the laws that were abolished. For the Lord, with all tranquility, was acting favorably toward them
    24: And similar things as have been comprised in five books by Jason the Cyrenean, we have attempted to abridge into one volume
    25: For, considering the multitude of the books, and the difficulty that those who are willing to undertake the narrations of histories find, due to the multitude of events
    26: we have taken care, so that, indeed, those who are willing to read may have delights of the mind, and so that, in truth, the studious may more easily be able to commit it to memory, and also so that all readers may find it useful
    27: And indeed, we ourselves, who have taken up the task of abridging this work, have no easy labor. For, in truth, more correctly, we have assumed an activity full of vigilance and sweat
    28: Just as those who prepare a feast also seek to be attentive to the will of others, for the sake of the gratitude of many, we willingly undertake the labor
    29: Indeed, leaving to the authors the truths about particular details, we instead have been devoted to this form, striving to be brief
    30: For, just as the architect of a new house will have concern for the entire structure, and, in truth, he who takes care to paint it will seek out what is fitting to adorn it, so also should such things be considered by us
    31: Moreover, to collect knowledge, and to order words, and to discuss every particular point attentively, is the duty of the author of a history
    32: Yet truly, to pursue brevity of speech, and to shun the extension of matters, is conceded to an abbreviator
    33: Therefore, here we will begin the narration. Let so much be sufficient to say in preface. For it is foolish to go on and on before the account, when the account itself is succinct

  Chapter 3.

    1: Therefore, when the holy city was inhabited with all peace, and also the laws were still being kept very well because of the piety of Onias, the high priest, and the hatred that his soul held for evil
    2: it happened that even the kings and princes themselves considered the place worthy of the highest honor, and so they glorified the temple with very great gifts
    3: so much so that Seleucus, king of Asia, furnished from his revenues all of the expenses for the ministry pertaining to the sacrifices
    4: But Simon, from the tribe of Benjamin, having been appointed as overseer of the temple, obstructed the chief priest, in order to undertake some kind of iniquity in the city
    5: But when he was not able to overcome Onias, he went to Apollonius, the son of Tarsus, who at that time was governor of Coelesyria and Phoenicia
    6: and he announced to him that the treasury in Jerusalem was full of innumerable sums of money, and that the common storehouse, which did not pertain to the allotment for the sacrifices, was immense, and that it would be possible for all of this to fall under the power of the king
    7: And when he had presented the news that he brought back to king Apollonius about the money, he summoned Heliodorus, who was in charge of this matter, and he sent him with orders, in order to transport the aforesaid money
    8: And immediately Heliodorus set forth on the way, indeed, appearing as if sojourning to the cities of Coelesyria and Phoenicia, but in truth the reason was to complete the proposition of the king
    9: But, when he had arrived at Jerusalem and had been kindly accepted into the city by the high priest, he explained to him the information that had been provided concerning the money. And he freely disclosed the cause for which he was present. But he questioned whether these things were truly so
    10: Then the high priest revealed to him that these things had been deposited, along with provisions for the widows and the orphans
    11: In truth, a certain part of that which impious Simon had reported belonged to Hyrcanus, son of Tobias, a very eminent man. But the entire amount was four hundred talents of silver and two hundred of gold
    12: For in truth, to deceive those who had trusted in the place and the temple that is honored throughout the whole world for its veneration and sanctity would be altogether impossible
    13: But because of those things that he held as orders from the king, he said that by all means the money must be transferred to the king
    14: And so, on the appointed day, Heliodorus entered to set these things in order. Yet truly, there was no small amount of trepidation throughout the entire city
    15: And so the priests threw themselves before the altar in their priestly vestments, and they called upon him from heaven, who had established the law about deposits, such that those with whom they had deposited it would keep it safe
    16: Now truly, whoever saw the countenance of the high priest was wounded in mind. For his face and the changing of its color declared the inner sorrow of the soul
    17: For this one man was so immersed in grief and in physical dread that it was clear to those who beheld him that sorrow had affected his heart
    18: And now, others flowed together in flocks from the houses, pleading and making public supplication, on behalf of the place, which soon might be brought into contempt
    19: And the women, wrapped with haircloth around the chest, flowed together through the streets. And even the virgins, who were cloistered, rushed forth to Onias, and others rushed to the walls, and, truly, certain ones looked through the windows
    20: But every one of them, stretching forth their hands toward heaven, made supplication
    21: For the expectation of the mixed multitude, and of the great priest in agony, would have endowed anyone with pity
    22: And indeed, these called upon almighty God, so that the trust that had been entrusted to them would be preserved with all integrity
    23: But Heliodorus completed the same thing that had been decreed, being himself present in the place, with his attendants, near the treasury
    24: Then the Spirit of Almighty God made a great manifestation of his presence, so much so that all who had presumed to yield to him were turned aside by fainting and dread, falling by the power of God
    25: For there appeared to them a certain horse, having a terrible rider, adorned with the best covering, and he rushed forth and assailed Heliodorus with his front hooves. And he who sat upon him seemed to have armor of gold
    26: Moreover, there appeared two other youths with the appearance of power, the glory of nobility, and the apparel of splendor. These stood near him on each side, and they scourged him without ceasing, striking with many scourges
    27: Then Heliodorus suddenly fell to the ground, and they quickly took him up, draped by a great darkness, and, having placed him onto a stretcher, they rushed him away
    28: And so, he who had approached the aforesaid treasury, with so many officials and attendants, was carried away, with no one to bring help to him, the manifest power of God being made known
    29: And indeed, through divine power, he lay mute and also was deprived of all hope of recovery
    30: But they blessed the Lord, because he had magnified his place, and because the temple, which a little while before was filled with confusion and fear, became filled with joy and gladness, when the all-powerful Lord appeared
    31: Then, truly, certain friends of Heliodorus came forth to petition Onias, so that he would call upon the Most High to grant life to him who was appointed to breathe his last breath
    32: But the high priest, considering that the king might perhaps suspect that some malice against Heliodorus had been completed by the Jews, offered a beneficial sacrifice for the health of the man
    33: And when the high priest was praying, the same youths, dressed in the same clothing, were standing by Heliodorus, and they said: “Give thanks to Onias the priest, for it is on his behalf that the Lord has granted life to you
    34: But, having been scourged by God, you must announce to all the great things of God and his power.” And having said this, they disappeared
    35: Then Heliodorus offered sacrifice to God and made great vows to him who had permitted him to live. And he gave thanks to Onias. And, gathering his troops, he returned to the king
    36: But he testified to all about the works of the great God, which he had seen with his own eyes
    37: And so, when the king questioned Heliodorus as to who might be fit to be sent once more to Jerusalem, he said
    38: “If you have any enemy, or a traitor to your kingdom, send him there, and he will return to you scourged, if he even escapes. For truly, in that place, there is a certain power of God
    39: Yes, he who has his dwelling in the heavens is the visitor and protector of that place, and he strikes and destroys those arriving to do evil.
    40: Thus, the things about Heliodorus and the preservation of the treasury happened in this way

  Chapter 4.

    1: But the aforementioned Simon, who was a betrayer of the money and of his nation, spoke evil about Onias, as if he had instigated Heliodorus to do these things and as if he had been the inciter of evils
    2: And he dared to say that he was a traitor to the kingdom, though he provided for the city, and defended his people, and was zealous for the law of God
    3: But when the hostilities had proceeded to such an extent that even murders were committed by certain close associates of Simon
    4: Onias, considering the peril of this contention, and Apollonius to be mad, though he was governor of Coelesyria and Phoenicia, which only augmented the malice of Simon, he brought himself before the king
    5: not so as to be an accuser of a citizen, but in view of his own consideration for the common good of the entire multitude
    6: For he saw that, without royal providence, it would be impossible to provide peace to events, nor would Simon ever cease from his foolishness
    7: But after the life of Seleucus expired, when Antiochus, who was called the illustrious, had assumed the kingdom, Jason, the brother of Onias, was ambitious for the high priesthood
    8: He went to the king, promising him three hundred and sixty talents of silver, and from other revenues eighty talents
    9: and beyond these, he promised also one hundred and fifty more, if he would be granted the authority to establish a sports arena, and a school for boys, and to enroll those who were at Jerusalem as Antiochians
    10: When the king had assented, and he had obtained the leadership, he immediately began to transfer his subjects to the rituals of the heathens
    11: And taking away those things that had been established by the kings, by reason of the humanitarianism of the Jews, through John, the father of Eupolemus, who formed a friendship and alliance with the Romans, he discharged the legitimate legislations, voiding the oaths of the citizens, and he sanctioned depraved customs
    12: For he even had the audacity to set up, below the very stronghold, a sports arena, and to place all of the best adolescent boys in brothels
    13: Now this was not the beginning, but a certain increase and progression of heathenism and foreign practices, due to the nefarious and unheard of wickedness of the impious non-priest Jason
    14: so much so that now the priests were not devoted to the concerns of services at the altar, but, despising the temple and neglecting the sacrifices, they hurried to become participants of the wrestling school, and of its prohibited injustices, and of the training of the discus
    15: And, even holding the honors of their fathers to be nothing, they esteemed the glories of the Greeks as best
    16: For the sake of these, they held a dangerous competition, and were imitators of their practices, and so, in all things, they desired to be similar to those who had been their enemies and destroyers
    17: But acting impiously against the divine laws does not go unpunished, as these subsequent events will reveal
    18: But when the competition that was celebrated every fifth year was at Tyre, the king being present
    19: the villainous Jason sent sinful men from Jerusalem, carrying three hundred didrachmas of silver for the sacrifice of Hercules. But those who transported it asked that it might not be paid out for the sacrifices, because it was not needed, but might be used for other expenses
    20: So, even though this was offered by him who sent it for the sacrifice of Hercules, it was instead given over to the manufacture of Greek warships, because of those presenting it
    21: Then Apollonius, the son of Menestheus, was sent into Egypt because of the nobles of king Philometor of Ptolemy. But when Antiochus realized that he had been effectively alienated from the affairs of the kingdom, consulting his own interests, he started out from there and came to Joppa, and from there to Jerusalem
    22: And he was received magnificently by Jason and the city, and he entered with the lights of little torches and with praises. And from there he turned back with his army to Phoenicia
    23: And, after three years, Jason sent Menelaus, the brother of the above mentioned Simon, carrying money to the king, and bearing responses about essential matters
    24: And he, being recommended to the king, when he had magnified the appearance of his power, usurped the high priesthood for himself, outbidding Jason by three hundred talents of silver
    25: And so, having received orders from the king, he returned, holding nothing at all worthy of the priesthood, in truth, having the soul of a cruel tyrant and the rage of a wild beast
    26: And indeed, Jason, who had taken captive his own brother, was himself deceived, and was expelled to become a fugitive in the region of the Ammonites
    27: Then Menelaus, indeed, obtained the principality, but truly, concerning the money that he had promised to the king, nothing was done. Although Sostratus, who was first over the stronghold, attempted to collect it
    28: since the collection of certain taxes pertained to him. For this reason, they were both called before the king
    29: And Menelaus was removed from the priesthood, being succeeded by Lysimachus, his brother. Then Sostratus was appointed over the Cyprians
    30: And while these things were occurring, it happened that those from Tarsus and Mallus incited a sedition, because they had been given as a gift to Antiochidi, the concubine of the king
    31: And so, the king hurried to come and calm them, leaving behind Andronicus, one of his associates, as his deputy
    32: Then Menelaus, believing that he had reached an opportune time, having stolen certain gold vessels out of the temple, gave them to Andronicus, along with others he had gained at Tyre and throughout the neighboring cities
    33: But when Onias had realized this with certainty, he accused him, keeping himself in a safe place at Antioch beside Daphne
    34: Meanwhile, Menelaus met with Andronicus, asking him to execute Onias. So he then went to Onias, and he gave him his right hand with an oath, and, even though he was suspicious of him, he persuaded him to venture out of asylum, and he immediately killed him, with no respect for justice
    35: For this reason, not only the Jews, but also the other nations, were indignant and bore much grief for the unjust killing of so great a man
    36: But when the king returned from the places of Cilicia, the Jews at Antioch, and similarly the Greeks, went to him, complaining of the iniquitous killing of Onias
    37: And so Antiochus was grieved in his mind because of Onias, and, being moved to compassion, he shed tears, remembering the sobriety and modesty of the deceased
    38: And, being inflamed in soul, he ordered the purple to be torn from Andronicus, and that he be led around, throughout the entire city, and that, in the same place where he had committed the impiety against Onias, the sacrilegious man should be deprived of his life, as his fitting punishment rendered by the Lord
    39: But when many sacrileges were committed by Lysimachus in the temple through the counsel of Menelaus, and the news was divulged, the multitude gathered together against Lysimachus, though a great quantity of gold had been exported already
    40: But when the multitude stirred up an insurrection, and their minds were filled with anger, Lysimachus armed about three thousand, who began to act with hands of iniquity. A certain tyrant was their leader, a man advanced both in age and in madness
    41: But when they perceived the attempt of Lysimachus, some took hold of stones, others strong clubs, and, in truth, certain ones threw ashes upon Lysimachus
    42: And indeed, many were wounded, and some were struck down; however, all were put to flight. And, as for the sacrilegious man, they executed him beside the treasury
    43: Therefore, about these things, a judgment began to be stirred up against Menelaus
    44: And when the king had arrived at Tyre, three men were sent from the elders to bring the matter to him
    45: But when Menelaus was overcome, he promised to give much money to Ptolemy to persuade the king
    46: And so, Ptolemy went to the king in a certain court where he was, as if merely to refresh himself, and he influenced him away from the sentence
    47: And so Menelaus, though indeed guilty of all malice, was absolved of the crimes. Moreover, these pitiable men, who, even if they had pleaded their case before Scythians, would have been judged innocent, he condemned to death
    48: Therefore, those who brought the case on behalf of the city, and the people, and the sacred vessels were quickly given an unjust punishment
    49: For this reason, even the Tyrians, being indignant, proved to be very liberal toward their burial
    50: Thus, because of the greed of those who were in power, Menelaus remained in authority, increasing in malice, to the betrayal of the citizens
