Day 342:

Reading Hebrews, chapters ['9', '10', '11', '12']:

  Chapter 9.

    1: Certainly, the former also had the justifications of worship and a holy place for that age
    2: For a tabernacle was made at first, in which were the lampstand, and the table, and the bread of the Presence, which is called Holy
    3: Then, beyond the second veil, was the tabernacle, which is called the Holy of Holies
    4: having a golden censer, and the ark of the testament, covered all around and on every part with gold, in which was a golden urn containing manna, and the rod of Aaron which had blossomed, and the tablets of the testament
    5: And over the ark were the Cherubim of glory, overshadowing the propitiatory. There is not enough time to speak about each of these things
    6: Yet truly, once such things were placed together, in the first part of the tabernacle, the priests were, indeed, continually entering, so as to carry out the duties of the sacrifices
    7: But into the second part, once a year, the high priest alone entered, not without blood, which he offered on behalf of the neglectful offenses of himself and of the people
    8: In this way, the Holy Spirit is signifying that the way to what is most holy was not yet made manifest, not while the first tabernacle was still standing
    9: And this is a parable for the present time. Accordingly, those gifts and sacrifices that are offered are not able, as concerns the conscience, to make perfect those things that serve only as food and drink
    10: as well as the various washings and justices of the flesh, which were imposed upon them until the time of correction
    11: But Christ, standing as the High Priest of future good things, through a greater and more perfect tabernacle, one not made by hand, that is, not of this creation
    12: entered once into the Holy of Holies, having obtained eternal redemption, neither by the blood of goats, nor of calves, but by his own blood
    13: For if the blood of goats and oxen, and the ashes of a calf, when these are sprinkled, sanctify those who have been defiled, in order to cleanse the flesh
    14: how much more will the blood of Christ, who through the Holy Spirit has offered himself, immaculate, to God, cleanse our conscience from dead works, in order to serve the living God
    15: And thus he is the Mediator of the new testament, so that, by his death, he intercedes for the redemption of those transgressions which were under the former testament, so that those who have been called may receive the promise of an eternal inheritance
    16: For where there is a testament, it is necessary for the death of the one who testifies to intervene
    17: For a testament is confirmed by death. Otherwise, it as yet has no force, as long as the one who testifies lives
    18: Therefore, indeed, the first was not dedicated without blood
    19: For when every commandment of the law had been read by Moses to the entire people, he took up the blood of calves and goats, with water and with scarlet wool and hyssop, and he sprinkled both the book itself and the entire people
    20: saying: “This is the blood of the testament which God has commanded for you.
    21: And even the tabernacle, and all the vessels for the ministry, he similarly sprinkled with blood
    22: And nearly everything, according to the law, is to be cleansed with blood. And without the shedding of blood, there is no remission
    23: Therefore, it is necessary for the examples of heavenly things to be cleansed, just as, indeed, these things were. Yet the heavenly things are themselves better sacrifices than these
    24: For Jesus did not enter by means of holy things made with hands, mere examples of the true things, but he entered into Heaven itself, so that he may appear now before the face of God for us
    25: And he did not enter so as to offer himself repeatedly, as the high priest enters into the Holy of Holies each year, with the blood of another
    26: Otherwise, he would need to have suffered repeatedly since the beginning of the world. But now, one time, at the consummation of the ages, he has appeared in order to destroy sin though his own sacrifice
    27: And in the same manner as it has been appointed for men to die one time, and after this, to be judged
    28: so also Christ was offered, one time, in order to empty the sins of so many. He shall appear a second time without sin, for those who await him, unto salvation

  Chapter 10.

    1: For the law contains the shadow of future good things, not the very image of these things. So, by the very same sacrifices which they offer ceaselessly each year, they can never cause these to approach perfection
    2: Otherwise, they would have ceased to be offered, because the worshipers, once cleansed, would no longer be conscious of any sin
    3: Instead, in these things, a commemoration of sins is made every year
    4: For it is impossible for sins to be taken away by the blood of oxen and goats
    5: For this reason, as Christ enters into the world, he says: “Sacrifice and oblation, you did not want. But you have fashioned a body for me
    6: Holocausts for sin were not pleasing to you
    7: Then I said, ‘Behold, I draw near.’ At the head of the book, it has been written of me that I should do your will, O God.
    8: In the above, by saying, “Sacrifices, and oblations, and holocausts for sin, you did not want, nor are those things pleasing to you, which are offered according to the law
    9: then I said, ‘Behold, I have come to do your will, O God,’ ” he takes away the first, so that he may establish what follows
    10: For by this will, we have been sanctified, through the one time oblation of the body of Jesus Christ
    11: And certainly, every priest stands by, ministering daily, and frequently offering the same sacrifices, which are never able to take away sins
    12: But this man, offering one sacrifice for sins, sits at the right hand of God forever
    13: awaiting that time when his enemies will be made his footstool
    14: For, by one oblation, he has brought to fulfillment, for all time, those who are sanctified
    15: Now the Holy Spirit also testifies for us about this. For afterward, he said
    16: “And this is the testament which I will commit to them after those days, says the Lord. I will instill my laws in their hearts, and I will inscribe my laws on their minds
    17: And I will no longer remember their sins and iniquities.
    18: Now, when there is a remission of these things, there is no longer an oblation for sin
    19: And so, brothers, have faith in the entrance into the Holy of Holies by the blood of Christ
    20: and in the new and living Way, which he has initiated for us by the veil, that is, by his flesh
    21: and in the Great Priest over the house of God
    22: So, let us draw near with a true heart, in the fullness of faith, having hearts cleansed from an evil conscience, and bodies absolved with clean water
    23: Let us hold fast to the confession of our hope, without wavering, for he who has promised is faithful
    24: And let us be considerate of one another, so as to prompt ourselves to charity and to good works
    25: not deserting our assembly, as some are accustomed to do, but consoling one another, and even more so as you see that the day is approaching
    26: For if we sin willingly, after receiving knowledge of the truth, there is no sacrifice remaining for sins
    27: but instead, a certain terrible expectation of judgment, and the rage of a fire that shall consume its adversaries
    28: If someone dies for acting against the law of Moses, and is shown no compassion because of two or three witnesses
    29: how much more, do you think, someone would deserve worse punishments, if he has tread upon the Son of God, and has treated the blood of the testament, by which he was sanctified, as unclean, and has acted with disgrace toward the Spirit of grace
    30: For we know that he has said: “Vengeance is mine, and I will repay,” and again, “The Lord will judge his people.
    31: It is dreadful to fall into the hands of the living God
    32: But call to mind the former days, in which, after being enlightened, you endured a great struggle of afflictions
    33: And certainly, in one way, by insults and tribulations, you were made a spectacle, but in another way, you became the companions of those who were the object of such behavior
    34: For you even had compassion on those who were imprisoned, and you accepted with gladness being deprived of your goods, knowing that you have a better and more lasting substance
    35: And so, do not lose your confidence, which has a great reward
    36: For it is necessary for you to be patient, so that, by doing the will of God, you may receive the promise
    37: “For, in a little while, and somewhat longer, he who is to come will return, and he will not delay
    38: For my just man lives by faith. But if he were to draw himself back, he would not please my soul.
    39: So then, we are not sons who are drawn away to perdition, but we are sons of faith toward the securing of the soul

  Chapter 11.

    1: Now, faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not apparent
    2: For this reason, the ancients were given testimony
    3: By faith, we understand the world to be fashioned by the Word of God, so that the visible might be made by the invisible
    4: By faith, Abel offered to God a much better sacrifice than that of Cain, through which he obtained testimony that he was just, in that God offered testimony to his gifts. And through that sacrifice, he still speaks to us, though he is dead
    5: By faith, Enoch was transferred, so that he would not see death, and he was not found because God had transferred him. For before he was transferred, he had testimony that he pleased God
    6: But without faith, it is impossible to please God. For whoever approaches God must believe that he exists, and that he rewards those who seek him
    7: By faith, Noah, having accepted an answer about those things which were not yet seen, being afraid, fashioned an ark for the salvation of his house. Through the ark, he condemned the world, and was established as the heir of the justice that occurs through faith
    8: By faith, the one called Abraham obeyed, going out to the place that he was to receive as an inheritance. And he went out, not knowing where he was going
    9: By faith, he stayed in the Land of the Promise as if in a foreign land, dwelling in cottages, with Isaac and Jacob, co-heirs of the same promise
    10: For he was awaiting a city having firm foundations, whose designer and builder is God
    11: By faith also, Sarah herself, being barren, received the ability to conceive offspring, even though she was past that age in life. For she believed him to be faithful, who had promised
    12: Because of this, there were also born, from one who himself was as if dead, a mulititude like the stars of heaven, who are, like the sand of the seashore, innumerable
    13: All of these passed away, adhering to faith, not having received the promises, yet beholding them from afar and saluting them, and confessing themselves to be sojourners and guests upon the earth
    14: For those who speak in this way are themselves indicating that they seek a homeland
    15: And if, indeed, they had been mindful of the very place from which they departed, they certainly would have returned in time
    16: But now they hunger for a better place, that is, Heaven. For this reason, God is not ashamed to be called their God. For he has prepared a city for them
    17: By faith, Abraham, when he was tested, offered Isaac, so that he who had received the promises was offering up his only son
    18: To him, it was said, “Through Isaac, shall your offspring be summoned,
    19: indicating that God is even able to raise up from the dead. And thus, he also established him as a parable
    20: By faith, also, Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau, concerning future events
    21: By faith, Jacob, as he was dying, blessed each of the sons of Joseph; and he reverenced the summit of his rod
    22: By faith, Joseph, as he was dying, recalled the departure of the sons of Israel, and gave a commandment concerning his bones
    23: By faith, Moses, after being born, was hidden for three months by his parents, because they had seen that he was a graceful infant, and they did not fear the king’s edict
    24: By faith, Moses, after growing up, denied himself a place as the son of Pharaoh’s daughter
    25: choosing to be afflicted with the people of God, rather than to have the pleasantness of sin for a time
    26: valuing the reproach of Christ to be a greater wealth than the treasures of the Egyptians. For he looked forward to his reward
    27: By faith, he abandoned Egypt, not dreading the animosity of the king. For he pressed on, as if seeing him who is unseen
    28: By faith, he celebrated the Passover and the shedding of the blood, so that he who destroyed the firstborn might not touch them
    29: By faith, they crossed the Red Sea, as if on dry land, yet when the Egyptians attempted it, they were swallowed up
    30: By faith, the walls of Jericho collapsed, after being encircled for seven days
    31: By faith, Rahab, the harlot, did not perish with the unbelievers, after receiving the spies with peace
    32: And what should I say next? For time is not sufficient for me to give an account of Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah, David, Samuel, and the Prophets
    33: those who, by faith, conquered kingdoms, accomplished justice, obtained promises, closed the mouths of lions
    34: extinguished the violence of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, recovered from infirmities, showed strength in battle, turned back the armies of foreigners
    35: Women received their dead by means of resurrection. But others suffered severe punishment, not yet receiving redemption, so that they would find a better resurrection
    36: Truly, others were tested by mocking and lashes, and moreover by chains and imprisonment
    37: They were stoned; they were cut; they were tempted. With the slaughter of the sword, they were killed. They wandered about in sheepskin and in goatskin, in dire need, in anguish afflicted
    38: Of them, the world was not worthy, wandering in solitude on mountains, in the caves and caverns of the earth
    39: And all these, having been proven by the testimony of faith, did not receive the Promise
    40: God’s Providence holds something better for us, so that not without us would they be perfected

  Chapter 12.

    1: Furthermore, since we also have so great a cloud of witnesses over us, let us set aside every burden and sin which may surround us, and advance, through patience, to the struggle offered to us
    2: Let us gaze upon Jesus, as the Author and the completion of our faith, who, having joy laid out before him, endured the cross, disregarding the shame, and who now sits at the right hand of the throne of God
    3: So then, meditate upon him who endured such adversity from sinners against himself, so that you may not become weary, failing in your souls
    4: For you have not yet resisted unto blood, while striving against sin
    5: And you have forgotten the consolation which speaks to you like sons, saying: “My son, do not be willing to neglect the discipline of the Lord. Neither should you become weary, while being rebuked by him.
    6: For whomever the Lord loves, he chastises. And every son whom he accepts, he scourges
    7: Persevere in discipline. God presents you to himself as sons. But what son is there, whom his father does not correct
    8: But if you are without that discipline in which all have become sharers, then you are of adultery, and you are not sons
    9: Then, too, we have certainly had the fathers of our flesh as instructors, and we reverenced them. Should we not obey the Father of spirits all the more, and so live
    10: And indeed, for a few days and according to their own wishes, they instructed us. But he does so to our benefit, so that we may receive his sanctification
    11: Now every discipline, in the present time, does not seem a gladness, of course, but a grief. But afterwards, it will repay a most peaceful fruit of justice to those who become trained in it
    12: Because of this, lift up your lazy hands and your lax knees
    13: and straighten the path of your feet, so that no one, being lame, may wander astray, but instead may be healed
    14: Pursue peace with everyone. Pursue sanctity, without which no one shall see God
    15: Be contemplative, lest anyone lack the grace of God, lest any root of bitterness spring up and impede you, and by it, many might be defiled
    16: lest any fornicator or worldly person be like Esau, who, for the sake of one meal, sold his birthright
    17: For you know that afterwards, when he desired to inherit the benediction, he was rejected. For he found no place for repentance, even though he had sought it with tears
    18: But you have not drawn near to a tangible mountain, or a burning fire, or a whirlwind, or a mist, or a storm
    19: or the sound of a trumpet, or a voice of words. Those who had experienced these things excused themselves, lest the Word be spoken to them
    20: For they could not bear what was said, and so, if even a beast would have touched the mountain, it would have been stoned
    21: And what was seen was so terrible that even Moses said: “I am terrified, and so, I tremble.
    22: But you have drawn near to mount Zion, and to the city of the living God, to the heavenly Jerusalem, and to the company of many thousands of Angels
    23: and to the Church of the first-born, those who have been inscribed in the heavens, and to God, the judge of all, and to the spirits of the just made perfect
    24: and to Jesus, the Mediator of the New Testament, and to a sprinkling of blood, which speaks better than the blood of Abel
    25: Be careful not to reject the One who is speaking. For if those who rejected him who was speaking upon the earth were not able to escape, so much more we who might turn away from the One who is speaking to us from heaven
    26: Then, his voice moved the earth. But now, he makes a promise, saying: “There is still one more time, and then I will move, not only the earth, but also heaven itself.
    27: And so, in saying, “There is still one more time,” he declares the transfer of the moveable things of creation, so that those things which are immoveable may remain
    28: Thus, in receiving an immoveable kingdom, we have grace. So, through grace, let us be of service, by pleasing God with fear and reverence
    29: For our God is a consuming fire
