Day 188:

Reading Wisdom, chapters ['5', '6', '7', '8']:

  Chapter 5.

    1: Then the just will stand with great steadfastness against those who have oppressed them and have taken away their labors
    2: Seeing this, they will be troubled with terrible fear, and they will be amazed at the suddenness of unexpected salvation
    3: Driven toward regret, and through the anguish of their groaning spirit, they will say within themselves:  “These are the ones whom we held for some time in derision and in mocking reproach
    4: We foolish considered their life to be madness, and their end to be without honor
    5: How is it that they are counted among the sons of God, and their place is among the holy
    6: Therefore, we have strayed from the way of truth, and the light of justice has not shined on us, and the sun of understanding has not risen on us
    7: We exhausted ourselves in the way of iniquity and perdition, and have walked a difficult way, while ignoring the way of the Lord
    8: How has arrogance benefited us? Or what has exalting in riches brought us
    9: All those things have passed away like a shadow, and like a messenger traveling quickly by
    10: and like a ship passing over the waves of water, when it has gone by, its trace cannot be found, nor can the pathway of its keel in the waves
    11: or, like a bird flying through the air, there is no evidence of her journey to be found, but there is hardly a sound as the beating of her wings lifts up the air and, by the force of her journey, divides the air she has flown across, which was disturbed by her wings, and afterwards there is no sign of her journey to be found
    12: or, like an arrow shot at a selected mark, the air continues to be divided and to be brought together again, so that its passing is unknown
    13: And in like manner we, having been born, continuously cease to exist, and indeed, we depart with no sign of virtue to show, but we are consumed in our malice.
    14: Such things those who sinned said in hell
    15: For the hope of the impious is like feathers, which are blown away by the wind, and like a thin foam, which is dispersed by a storm, and like smoke, which is scattered by the wind, and like the memory of a guest who passes by one day
    16: But the just will live forever, and their reward is with the Lord, and the thought of them is with the Most High
    17: Therefore, they will receive a beautiful kingdom and a crown of splendor from the hand of the Lord, for with his right hand he will cover them, and with his holy arm he will defend them
    18: And his zeal will take up arms, and he will equip his servants for retribution on their enemies
    19: He will put on justice as a breastplate, and he will grasp sure judgment as a helmet
    20: He will select fairness as an invincible shield
    21: Yet he will sharpen his severe wrath into a spear, and he will fight with those of the world against the irrational
    22: Shafts of lightning will hurl forth accurately, and, as if from a well-curved bow of clouds, they will be expelled and will fly to the determined mark
    23: And hail will be cast like stones full of anger, and the water of the sea will rise up against them, and the rivers will charge forth harshly
    24: The spirit of virtue will stand firm against them and like a whirlwind will divide them, and he will lead all the world of iniquity into a wasteland, and malice will overthrow the seats of power

  Chapter 6.

    1: Wisdom is better than power, and a prudent man is better than a powerful one
    2: Therefore, hear, O kings, and understand; learn, you judges of the ends of the earth
    3: Listen closely, you who hold the attention of the crowds, and who please yourselves by disturbing the nations
    4: For power has been given to you from the Lord and strength from the Most High, who will examine your works and scrutinize your thoughts
    5: For, when you were ministers of his kingdom, you did not judge correctly, nor keep the law of justice, nor walk according to the will of God
    6: Horribly and quickly he will appear to you, because he will make a severe judgment for those who are in charge
    7: For, to the little, great mercy is granted, but the powerful will endure powerful torment
    8: For the Lord will not exempt anyone’s character, nor will he stand in awe of anyone’s greatness, because he himself made the little and the great, and he is equally concerned for everyone
    9: But a powerful torture pursues the powerful
    10: Therefore, O kings, these, my words, are for you, so that you may learn wisdom and not perish
    11: For those who have justly preserved justice will be justified, and those who have learned these things will find what to answer
    12: Therefore, desire my words, love them, and you will have instruction
    13: Wisdom is pure and never fades away, and is easily seen by those who love her and found by those who seek her
    14: She anticipates those who desire her, so that she first reveals herself to them
    15: Whoever awakens early to seek her, will not labor, for he will find her sitting at his door
    16: Therefore, by thinking about her, understanding is perfected, and whoever remains watchful for her, will quickly be secure
    17: For she goes about seeking such as are worthy of her, and she reveals herself to them cheerfully in the ways, and meets them with all foresight
    18: For the very true beginning of her is the desire for instruction
    19: Therefore, the zeal for instruction is love, and love is the keeping of her laws, and the keeping of her laws is the perfection of incorruptibility
    20: while incorruptibility makes us near to God
    21: And so, the desire for wisdom leads to an everlasting kingdom
    22: If, therefore, your delight is in thrones and scepters, O kings of the people, love wisdom, so that you may reign forever
    23: love the light of wisdom, all you who lead the peoples
    24: But what wisdom is, and how she was made, I will report, and I will not hide the mysteries of God from you, but I will investigate her from the beginning of her birth, and I will place the knowledge of her in the light, and will not pass over the truth
    25: Neither will I hold to the path that dwindles away with envy, because such a man will not partake in wisdom
    26: For the proliferation of the wise is sanity for the world, and a wise king is the mainstay of the people
    27: Therefore, receive instruction by my words, and it will benefit you

  Chapter 7.

    1: Certainly, I myself am also a mortal man, like everyone, and the offspring of this earth, which was made beforehand; and in my mother’s womb I was fashioned with care
    2: within the time of ten months, made of blood, from the seed of man and the delight of sleeping together
    3: And when I was born, I drew in the common air, and in similar fashion, I fell upon the earth, and the first voice I uttered, like everyone, was crying
    4: I was nursed in swaddling clothes and with great care
    5: For none of the kings had any other beginning of birth
    6: Therefore, there is only one entrance for everyone into life, and the same in leaving
    7: Because of this, I chose, and understanding was given to me; and I prayed, and the spirit of wisdom came to me
    8: and I placed her before kingdoms and thrones, and I considered riches nothing in comparison with her
    9: Neither did I compare to her a precious stone, for all gold in comparison with her is like a little sand, and silver, in view of her, will be valued as if dirt
    10: I loved her above health and beauty, and I placed having her before light, for her light is unfailing
    11: Yet all good things came to me together with her, and innumerable honors by her hand
    12: and I rejoiced in all these, because this wisdom went before me, although I did not know that she is the mother of them all
    13: This I have learned without falsehood and communicate without envy, and her integrity I do not hide
    14: Indeed, she is an infinite treasure chest for men, and those who make use of it, become partakers in the friendship of God, because they are recommended by the gifts of instruction
    15: Yet God has given to me to speak my mind, and to conceive thoughts worthy of those things that are given to me, because he is the leader of wisdom and the repairer of understanding
    16: For in his hand are both we, and our words, and all wisdom, and the works of science, and instruction
    17: For he has given me true knowledge of these things which exist:  so as to know the orderly arrangement of the world, and the powers of the elements
    18: the beginning and the end and the midpoint of the seasons, the characteristics of changing things, and the divisions of time
    19: the courses of the years, and the orderly arrangement of the stars
    20: the natures of animals, and the rage of wild beasts, the force of winds, and the reasonings of men, the diversities of plants, and the benefits of roots
    21: and all such things as are hidden and unexpected, I have learned; for wisdom, the artisan of all things, taught me
    22: For in her is the spirit of understanding:  holy, singular, manifold, subtle, perceptive, lively, chaste, reliable, gracious, loving, good, astute, who forbids nothing beneficial
    23: humane, kind, steadfast, trustworthy, secure, having all virtue, watching for all things and grasping all things with a pure and most delicate understanding of spirit
    24: For wisdom is more active than all active things, yet she reaches everywhere because of her purity
    25: For she is a breath of the virtue of God and a genuine emanation from the purity of the almighty God, and therefore nothing unclean can invade her
    26: Indeed, she is the brightness of eternal light, and the unspotted mirror of the majesty of God, and the image of his goodness
    27: And though she is one, she can do all things; and, unchanging in herself, she renews all things, and throughout the nations she conveys herself to holy souls, establishing them as friends and prophets of God
    28: For God loves none but those who dwell with wisdom
    29: For she is more spectacular than the sun, and above the array of all the stars; compared with the light, she is found to be before it
    30: Indeed, after her comes night, but wisdom will not be overcome by malice

  Chapter 8.

    1: Thus, she reaches mightily from one end all the way to the other, and she orders all things sweetly
    2: I have loved her and searched for her from my youth, and have asked to take her to me as my spouse, and I became a lover of her form
    3: She glorifies her lineage by having companionship with God; yes and of all things, the Lord loves her
    4: For she teaches the teaching of God and is the chooser of his works
    5: And if riches are longed for in life, what is richer than wisdom, which is being served in all things
    6: But if the mind is to be served, who, of all that exists, is a greater artisan than she
    7: And if anyone loves justice, her labors hold great virtues; for she teaches temperance and prudence, justice and virtue, and nothing is more useful in human life
    8: And if one desires a multitude of knowledge, she knows the past and forecasts the future; she knows the subtleties of conversation and the response to arguments; she understands the signs and portents, before the events take place, events both of the present time and of future ages
    9: Therefore, I resolved to take her to me to live together, knowing that she will be a good counselor and will console my thoughts and my weariness
    10: Because of her, I have clarity in the midst of confusion, and honor among the elders in my youth
    11: and I will be found to be astute in judgment, and will be admired in the sight of the mighty, and the faces of leaders will wonder at me
    12: When I am silent, they will wait for me; when I speak, they will respect me; and when I talk for too long, they will put their hands on their mouths
    13: Thus, by means of her, I will have immortality, and I will bequeath an everlasting memorial to those who come after me
    14: I will set the peoples in order, and nations will be subject to me
    15: Hearing me, terrible kings will be afraid; to the multitude, I will be seen as good and valiant in war
    16: When I go into my house, I will repose myself with her, for her conversation has no bitterness, nor her company any tediousness, but only joy and gladness
    17: Thinking these things within myself, and recalling in my heart that immortality is the intention of wisdom
    18: and that in her friendship is good enjoyment, and in the works of her hands are honors without flaw, and in debate with her is understanding, and glory in sharing conversation with her; I went about seeking, so that I might take her to myself
    19: For I was an ingenious boy and had been dealt a good soul
    20: Even more so, being good, I came to have an undefiled body
    21: And since I know that it is not possible to be chaste except as a gift from God, and that it is a point of wisdom to know whose gift it is, I approached the Lord, and I besought him, and I said with my whole heart
