Day 282:

Reading 2-Maccabees, chapters ['9', '10', '11', '12']:

  Chapter 9.

    1: At the same time, Antiochus returned in dishonor from Persia
    2: For he had entered into the city called Persepolis, and attempted to rob the temple, and to oppress the city, but the multitude, rushing to arms, turned them to flight, and so it happened that Antiochus, after fleeing, returned in disgrace
    3: And when he had arrived near Ecbatana, he realized what had happened to Nicanor and Timothy
    4: And so, rising up in anger, he thought to turn back upon the Jews the injury done by those who had put him to flight. And, therefore, he ordered his chariot to be driven without stopping along the way, for the judgment of heaven was urging him on, because he had spoken so arrogantly about how he would come to Jerusalem and make it into a mass grave for the Jews
    5: But the Lord God of Israel, who oversees all things, struck him with an incurable and invisible plague. For, as soon as he had finished these words, a dire pain in his abdomen seized him, with bitter internal torments
    6: And, indeed, it sprung forth justly, since he had tormented the internal organs of others with many strange and new tortures, yet he in no way ceased from his malice
    7: But, beyond this, being filled with arrogance, breathing fire with his soul against the Jews, and instructing the task to be accelerated, it happened that, as he was rushing on forcefully, he fell from the chariot, and his limbs were afflicted with a serious bruising of the body
    8: And he, being filled with arrogance beyond human means, seemed to himself to command even the waves of the sea and to weigh even the heights of the mountains in a balance. But now, humbled to the ground, he was carried on a stretcher, calling himself as a witness to the manifest virtue of God
    9: So then, worms swarmed from his impious body, and, as he lived on in pain, his flesh fell away, and then his odorous stench oppressed the army
    10: And him who, a little before, thought that he could touch the stars of heaven, no one could endure to carry, because of the intolerable stench
    11: And so, from then on, being led away from his heavy arrogance by the admonishment of a divine plague, he began to come to an understanding of himself, with his pains increasing through every moment
    12: And, when he could not even bear his own stench, he spoke in this way: “It is just to be subject to God, and a mortal should not consider himself equal to God.
    13: Then this wicked one prayed to the Lord, from whom, subsequently, there might be no mercy
    14: And the city, to which he was going in haste to pull it down to the ground and to make it a mass grave, he now wanted to make free
    15: And the Jews, whom he had said he certainly did not consider worthy even to be buried, but would deliver them to be torn apart by birds and wild beasts, and would exterminate them with their little ones, he now promised to make equal with the Athenians
    16: And even the holy temple, which before he had plundered, he would adorn with the best gifts, and increase the holy vessels, and pay out from his revenues the charges pertaining to the sacrifices
    17: Beyond these things, he would even become a Jew himself, and would travel through every place on earth and declare the power of God
    18: But, when his pains did not cease, (for the just judgment of God had overwhelmed him,) in despair he wrote to the Jews, in the manner of a supplication, a letter composed in this way
    19: “To the very good citizens of the Jews, Antiochus, king and ruler, wishes much health, and welfare, and happiness
    20: If you and your sons are faring well, and if everything is according to your will, we give very great thanks
    21: And so, fixed in infirmity, yet kindly remembering you, I am returning from the places of Persia, and, having been seized by a serious infirmity, I considered it necessary to have a concern for the common good
    22: not despairing in myself, but having a great hope to escape the infirmity
    23: Moreover, considering that my father also, during the time that he led an army into the upper regions, revealed who would take up the leadership after him
    24: so that, if anything contrary should occur, or any if difficulties should be reported, those who were in the regions, knowing to whom the whole matter had been bequeathed, would not be disturbed
    25: In addition to these things, considering that whichever are the nearest powers and neighbors lie in ambush for the right time and await the right event, I have designated my son, Antiochus, as king, whom I frequently commended to many of you while traveling in the upper provinces. And I have written to him what I have added below
    26: And so, I beg you and petition you, that remembering the public and private benefits, each one will continue to be faithful to me and to my son
    27: For I trust that he will behave with moderation and humanity, and that, following my intentions, he will be impartial to you.
    28: And so the murderer and blasphemer, having been struck very badly, just as he himself had treated others, passed from this life in a miserable death on a journey among the mountains
    29: But Philip, who was nurtured with him, carried away his body, and, fearing the son of Antiochus, went into Egypt to Ptolemy Philometor

  Chapter 10.

    1: But Maccabeus and those who were with him, the Lord protecting them, even recovered the temple and the city
    2: Then he demolished the altars, which the foreigners had constructed in the streets, and likewise the shrines
    3: And, having purged the temple, they made another altar. And, taking glowing stones from the fire, they began to offer sacrifices again after two years, and they set out incense, and lamps, and the bread of the Presence
    4: Having done these things, they petitioned the Lord, lying prostrate on the ground, lest they should fall once more into such evils, but also, if they should at any time sin, that they might be chastised by him more mildly, and not be delivered over to barbarians and blasphemous men
    5: Then, on the day that the temple had been polluted by the foreigners, it happened on the same day that the purification was accomplished, on the twenty-fifth day of the month, which was Kislev
    6: And they celebrated for eight days with joy, in the manner of the Feast of Tabernacles, remembering that, a little time before, they had celebrated the solemn days of the Feast of Tabernacles in mountains and caves, in the manner of wild beasts
    7: Because of this, they now preferred to carry boughs and green branches and palms, for him who had prospered the cleansing of his place
    8: And they decreed a common precept and decree, that all the people of the Jews should keep those days every year
    9: Now certainly Antiochus, who was called illustrious, held himself to be so at the passing of his life
    10: But next we will describe what happened with Eupator, the son of the impious Antiochus, abridging the evils which happened in the wars
    11: For when he assumed the kingdom, he appointed, over the affairs of the kingdom, a certain Lysias, leader of the Phoenician and Syrian military
    12: For Ptolemy, who was called Macer,  decided to be strict in justice toward the Jews, especially because of the iniquity that had been done to them, and to deal with them peacefully
    13: But, for this reason, he was accused before Eupator by his friends, and was frequently called a traitor. For he had deserted Cyprus, which Philometor had entrusted to him. And so, transferring to Antiochus the illustrious, he even withdrew from him. And he ended his life by poison
    14: But Gorgias, when he was the leader of the places, taking to him new arrivals, frequently made war against the Jews
    15: In truth, the Jews, who held the strategic fortresses, took in those who were fleeing from Jerusalem, and they attempted to make war
    16: In fact, those who were with Maccabeus, petitioning the Lord through prayers to be their helper, made a forceful attack upon the fortresses of the Idumeans
    17: And, persevering with much force, they obtained the places, killing those they met, and cutting down in all no less than twenty thousand
    18: Yet certain ones, when they had fled into two well-fortified towers, gave all appearance of fighting back
    19: So Maccabeus left behind Simon and Joseph, and likewise Zachaeus, and those who were with them, to fight against them. And since those who were with them were sufficient in number, he turned back to those who attacked more forcefully
    20: In truth, those who were with Simon, being led by avarice, were persuaded by money from certain ones who were in the towers. And accepting seventy thousand didrachmas, they allowed certain ones to flee
    21: But when what was done had been reported to Maccabeus, gathering together the leaders of the people, he accused those who had sold their brothers for money, having sent away their adversaries
    22: Therefore, he executed these who had acted as traitors, and he quickly captured the two towers
    23: And so, having success in arms and in all things that he took in hand, he destroyed more than twenty thousand in the two fortresses
    24: And Timothy, who had been overcome by the Jews before, calling together a multitude of foreign troops and gathering horsemen from Asia, arrived as if he would capture Judea with arms
    25: But Maccabeus, and those who were with him, as he was approaching, beseeched the Lord, sprinkling dirt on their heads and wrapping their waists with haircloth
    26: And lying prostrate at the pedestal of the altar, they beseeched him to be forgiving to them, but to be an enemy to their enemies, and an adversary to their adversaries, just as the law says
    27: And so, after prayer, taking up arms, they proceeded further from the city, and, reaching close proximity to the enemies, they settled in
    28: But, as soon as the sun rose, both sides joined battle: these ones having the guarantee of victory and success by the strength of the Lord, yet the others having courage as their leader in battle
    29: But, while they were fighting vehemently, to the adversaries there appeared from heaven five men on horses, which were adorned with bridles of gold, providing leadership to the Jews
    30: Two of them, having Maccabeus in the middle and surrounding him with their weapons, kept him safe. But, at the enemy, they cast darts and lightning, so that they fell down, being both confused with blindness and filled with disturbances
    31: Moreover, there were slain twenty thousand five hundred, along with six hundred horsemen
    32: In fact, Timothy fled away to Gazara, to a fortified stronghold, where Chaereas was in charge
    33: Then Maccabeus, and those who were with him, joyfully besieged the stronghold for four days
    34: But those who were inside, trusting to the strength of the place, spoke evil without limit and cast out nefarious words
    35: But when the fifth day began to dawn, twenty youths of those who were with Maccabeus, inflamed in soul because of the blasphemy, manfully approached to the wall, and, advancing with fierce courage, ascended it
    36: Moreover, others also getting up after them, went to set fire to the towers and the gates, and to burn the blasphemers alive
    37: Then, having continued throughout two days to lay waste to the fortress, they killed Timothy, who was found hiding himself in a certain place. And they also killed his brother Chaereas, and Apollophanes
    38: When this was done, they blessed the Lord with hymns and confessions, who had done great things in Israel and had given them the victory

  Chapter 11.

    1: But a short time afterwards, Lysias, the procurator of the king and a near relative, who also was in charge of the government, was heavily weighed upon by what had happened
    2: Gathering together eight thousand, along with all the horsemen, he came against the Jews, thinking that the city would certainly be captured, making it a dwelling place for the Gentiles
    3: in truth, also thinking to make a profit in money from the temple, just as from the other shrines of the Gentiles, and to put the priesthood up for sale every year
    4: Never recognizing the power of God, but inflated in mind, he trusted in the multitude of the foot soldiers, and in the thousands of horsemen, and in the eighty elephants
    5: And so, he entered Judea, and, approaching Bethzur, which was in a narrow place, at an interval of five stadia from Jerusalem, he laid siege to that stronghold
    6: But when Maccabeus and those who were with him realized that the strongholds were besieged, they and all the crowd together petitioned the Lord with weeping and tears, that he would send a good Angel to save Israel
    7: And so the leader Maccabeus, taking up arms, exhorted the others, to undergo the peril together with him, and to bring assistance to their brothers
    8: And when they together were going forth with a ready spirit, there appeared at Jerusalem a horseman, preceding them in radiant clothing and with weapons of gold, waving a spear
    9: Then they all together blessed the merciful Lord, and strengthened their souls, being prepared to break through not only men, but also the most ferocious beasts and walls of iron
    10: Thus, they went forth readily, having a helper from heaven, and with the Lord taking pity on them
    11: Then, rushing violently against the enemy, in the manner of lions, they struck down from among them: eleven thousand foot soldiers and one thousand six hundred horsemen
    12: And they turned all the rest to flight. But many of them, being wounded, escaped with nothing. And Lysias himself also escaped, fleeing in disgrace
    13: And because he was not irrational, thinking to himself about the loss that had happened against him, and understanding the Hebrews to be invincible because they depend upon the help of Almighty God, he sent to them
    14: and he promised that he would agree to all things that are just, and that he would persuade the king to be their friend
    15: Then Maccabeus assented to the request of Lysias, considering it useful in every way. And whatever Maccabeus wrote to Lysias, concerning the Jews, the king consented to it
    16: For there were letters written to the Jews from Lysias, which, indeed, were composed in this way: “Lysias, to the people of the Jews: greetings
    17: John and Absalom, who had been sent from you to deliver your writings, requested that I would implement these things that were signified by them
    18: Therefore, whatever things could be brought before the king, I have presented them. And he has conceded to those things that are permitted
    19: If, therefore, you will keep yourselves faithful in these matters, then, from now on, I will endeavor to be a cause of your good
    20: But as for other particulars, I have given orders by word, both to these, and to those who have been sent by me, to confer with you
    21: Farewell. In the one hundred forty-eighth year, on the twenty-fourth day of the month of Dioscorus.
    22: But the letter of the king contained this: “King Antiochus to Lysias, his brother: greetings
    23: Since our father has been transferred among the gods, we are willing that those who are in our kingdom should act without tumult, and should attend diligently to their own concerns
    24: We have heard that the Jews would not consent to my father to convert to the rites of the Greeks, but that they chose to keep to their own institutions, and, because of this, that they ask of us to leave them to their own laws
    25: Therefore, wanting this nation, likewise, to be at rest, we have reached a judgment that the temple should be restored to them, so that they may act according to the custom of their ancestors
    26: You will do well, therefore, if you send to them and grant them a pledge, so that our will becomes known, and they may be of good courage, and may look after their own needs.
    27: Truly, the letter of the king to the Jews was such as this: “King Antiochus to the senate of the Jews, and to the rest of the Jews: greetings
    28: If you are well, such is what we desire. But we ourselves are also well
    29: Menelaus came to us, saying that you wished to come down to your own, who are among us
    30: Therefore, we grant a pledge of security to those who come and go, even until the thirtieth day of the month of Xanthicus
    31: so that the Jews may make use of their own foods and laws, just as also before, and so that none of them should endure any kind of trouble for things which have been done by ignorance
    32: And so, we have also sent Menelaus, who will talk with you
    33: Farewell. In the one hundred forty-eighth year, on the fifteenth day of the month of Xanthicus.
    34: But the Romans also now sent a letter, having this in it: “Quintus Memmius and Titus Manilius, ambassadors of the Romans, to the people of the Jews: greetings
    35: Concerning these things that Lysias, the relative of the king, has conceded to you, we also have conceded
    36: But about such things as he judged should be referred to the king, send someone, as soon as you have diligently conferred among yourselves, so that we may make a decree, just as it is agreeable to you. For we are going to Antioch
    37: And, therefore, make haste to write back, so that we may know whatever your will may be
    38: Farewell. In the one hundred forty-eighth year, on the fifteenth day of the month of Xanthicus.

  Chapter 12.

    1: After these pacts were made, Lysias proceeded on to the king, but the Jews undertook the work of agriculture
    2: However, those who had withdrawn: Timothy, and Apollonius, the son of Gennaeus, along with Hieronymus, and Demophon, and, in addition to these, Nicanor, the governor of Cyprus, would not permit them to live in peace and quiet
    3: Truly, those of Joppa were also perpetrators of very shameful acts. They asked the Jews, who lived among them, to go up into small boats, which they had prepared, with their wives and sons, as if no underlying hostility was between them
    4: And so, according to the common decree of the city, they acquiesced to them, having no suspicions and because there was peace. When they had proceeded out into deep water, they drowned no less than two hundred of them
    5: When Judas learned of the cruelty done to the men of his nation, he informed the men who were with him, and, having called upon God, the Just Judge
    6: he went against the executors of his brothers, and he even set the port on fire in the night; he burned the boats, but those who took refuge from the fire, he destroyed with the sword
    7: And when he had done these things in this way, he departed, as if he would return again to eradicate all those of Joppa
    8: But when he also realized those who were of Jamnia wanted to act in a similar way to the Jews living among them
    9: he went against those of Jamnia also by night, and he set the port on fire, along with the ships, so much so that the light of the fire was seen at Jerusalem, two hundred and forty stadia away
    10: When they had now gone from there nine stadia, and were making their way toward Timothy, they met in battle with those of Arabia: five thousand men and five hundred horsemen
    11: And when a strong fight occurred, and, by the help of God, it ceased favorably, the remainder of the Arabians who were overcome petitioned Judas to give them a pledge, promising to give him pastures and to assist him in other things in the future
    12: Then Judas, thinking that they truly might be useful in many ways, promised peace. And after receiving the pledge of his right hand, they withdrew to their tents
    13: Then he also assaulted a certain strong city, surrounded with bridges and walls, which was inhabited by a crowd from many different nations, the name of which is Casphin
    14: In truth, those who were inside, trusting in the strength of the walls and in the preparations of rations, acted irresponsibly, and they challenged Judas with evil words and blaspheming, as well as by speaking what is not lawful
    15: But Maccabeus rushed fiercely to the walls, calling upon the great Leader of the world, who, without battering rams or machines of war, had thrown down the walls of Jericho in the time of Joshua
    16: And, having captured the city through the will of the Lord, he made a slaughter without number, so much so that an adjoining pool, two stadia in width, was seen to flow with the blood of the slain
    17: From there, they withdrew seven hundred and fifty stadia, and they came to Charax, to those Jews who are called Tubianites
    18: And Timothy, indeed, they did not find in those places, for he withdrew before he completed any endeavor, having left behind a very strong garrison in a certain place
    19: But Dositheus and Sosipater, who were commanders with Maccabeus, destroyed those who were left behind by Timothy in the stronghold: ten thousand men
    20: And Maccabeus, having positioned six thousand men around him and having divided them into cohorts, went forth against Timothy, who had with him one hundred twenty thousand foot soldiers, and two thousand five hundred horsemen
    21: But when Timothy learned of the arrival of Judas, he sent ahead the women, and the children, and the remainder of the preparations, into a fortress, which is called Carnion. For it was impregnable and difficult to access because of the narrowness of the places
    22: And when the first cohort of Judas had appeared, the enemies were struck with fear by the presence of God, who beholds all things, and they were turned to flight, one over another, to such an extent that they were being knocked over by one another and were being wounded with the strokes of their own swords
    23: But Judas pursued them vehemently, punishing the profane and striking down thirty thousand of their men
    24: In truth, Timothy himself fell to the group under Dositheus and Sosipater. And with much begging, he pleaded with them to release him alive, because he held the parents and brothers of many of the Jews, who, at his death, might happen to be mistreated
    25: And when he had given his faith that he would restore them according to the agreement, they released him unharmed, for the sake of their brothers’ well-being
    26: Then Judas departed to Carnion, where he slew twenty-five thousand
    27: After having put to flight or killed these, he moved his army to Ephron, a fortified city, in which there lived a multitude of diverse peoples. And hardy young men, standing upon the walls, put up a strong fight. Moreover, in this place, there were many machines of war, and equipment for casting darts
    28: But when they had called upon the Almighty, who with his power breaks the strength of enemies, they seized the city. And they struck down twenty-five thousand of those who were inside
    29: From there, they went to the city of Scythia, which was six hundred stadia away from Jerusalem
    30: But the Jews, those who were among the Scythians, testified that they were treated kindly by them, and that, even in the times of unhappiness, they had treated them mildly
    31: They gave thanks to them, exhorting them to be kind to their people, now and at other times. And they went to Jerusalem, as the solemn days of the seven weeks were underway
    32: And, after Pentecost, they marched against Gorgias, the foremost leader over Idumea
    33: And he went out with three thousand foot soldiers and four hundred horsemen
    34: And when they came together, it happened that a few of the Jews were overthrown
    35: In fact, a certain Dositheus, a horseman of Bacenor, a strong man, took hold of Gorgias. And when he would have captured him alive, a certain horseman of the Thracians rushed upon him and cut off his arm, and so, in this way, Gorgias escaped to Maresa
    36: But when those who were with Esdris had fought all day and were fatigued, Judas called upon the Lord to be their helper and leader in the battle
    37: Beginning in the language of the fathers, and loudly extolling hymns, he inspired the soldiers of Gorgias to take flight
    38: Then Judas, having collected his army, went into the city Adullam. And, when the seventh day came, they purified themselves according to the custom, and  they kept the Sabbath in the same place
    39: And the following day, Judas came with his own, in order to take away the bodies of the fallen, and to place them in the sepulchers of their fathers with their ancestors
    40: But they found, under the tunics of the slain, some of the treasures of the idols that were near Jamnia, which were prohibited to Jews by the law. Therefore, it became manifest that it was for this reason that they had been overthrown
    41: And so, they all blessed the just judgment of the Lord, who had made hidden things manifest
    42: So then, turning themselves to prayers, they petitioned him that the offense which had been done would be delivered into oblivion. And truly, the very strong Judas exhorted the people to keep themselves without sin, since they had seen with their own eyes what had happened because of the sins of those who were struck down
    43: And, calling an assembly, he sent twelve thousand drachmas of silver to Jerusalem, to be offered for a sacrifice for the sins of the dead, thinking well and religiously about the resurrection
    44: (for if he had not hoped that those who had fallen would be resurrected, it would have seemed superfluous and vain to pray for the dead,
    45: and because he considered that those who had fallen asleep with piety had great grace stored up for them
    46: Therefore, it is a holy and beneficial thought to pray on behalf of those who have passed away, so that they may be released from sins
