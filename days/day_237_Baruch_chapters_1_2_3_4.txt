Day 237:

Reading Baruch, chapters ['1', '2', '3', '4']:

  Chapter 1.

    1: And these are the words of the book, which Baruch the son of Neraiah, the son of Mahseiah, the son of Zedekiah, the son of Hasadiah, the son Hilkiah, wrote in Babylon
    2: in the fifth year, on the seventh day of the month, since the time when the Chaldeans captured Jerusalem and set it on fire
    3: And Baruch read the words of this book to the ears of Jeconiah, the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah, and to the ears of the entire people, who came to the book
    4: even to the ears of the powerful sons of kings, and to the ears of the elders, and to the ears of the people, from the least to the greatest of them, of all those living in Babylon, near the river Sud
    5: And upon hearing it, they wept and fasted and prayed in the sight of the Lord
    6: And they collected money in accordance with whatever each one was able to handover
    7: And they sent it to Jerusalem to Jehoiakim, the son of Hilkiah, the son of Shalum the priest, and to the priests, and to all the people, who were found with him in Jerusalem
    8: At that time, he received the vessels of the temple of the Lord (which had been carried away from the temple) so as to return them to the land of Judah, on the tenth day of the month Sivan. These were the silver vessels, which Zedekiah, the son of Josiah king of Judah, had made
    9: After this, Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, captured Jeconiah, and the leaders, and all the powerful, and the people of the land, and led them captive from Jerusalem to Babylon
    10: And they said, “Behold we have sent you money with which to buy holocausts and frankincense. Therefore, make manna and offer it for sin at the altar of the Lord our God
    11: And pray for the life of Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, and for the life of Belshazzar his son, so that their days may be just like the days of the heaven above the earth
    12: and so that the Lord may give virtue to us, and enlighten our eyes, so that we may live under the shadow of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, and under the shadow of Belshazzar his son, and so that we may serve them for many days and may find favor in their sight
    13: And pray for us also to the Lord our God, for we have sinned against the Lord our God, and the madness of our sin has not been driven away from us even to this day
    14: And read this book, which we have sent to you to be recited in the temple of the Lord, on solemn days and on other suitable days
    15: And you will say, ‘To the Lord our God is justice, but to us is confusion of our face, just as it is this day for all of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem
    16: even for our kings, and our leaders, and our priests, and our prophets, and our fathers
    17: We have sinned before the Lord our God and we have not believed, lacking confidence in him
    18: And we have not been submissive to him, and we have not listened to the voice of the Lord our God, so as to walk in his commandments, which he has given to us
    19: From the day that he led our fathers out of the land of Egypt, even to this day, we were unfaithful to the Lord our God, and, having been scattered, we fell away. We did not listen to his voice
    20: And we joined ourselves to many evils and to the curses which the Lord established through Moses, his servant, who led our fathers out of the land of Egypt, to give us a land flowing with milk and honey, just as it is in the present day
    21: And we have not listened to the voice of the Lord our God, according to all the words of the prophets whom he sent to us
    22: And we have gone astray, each one after the inclinations of his own malignant heart, serving strange gods and doing evil before the eyes of the Lord our God

  Chapter 2.

    1: “ ‘For this reason, the Lord our God has fulfilled his word, which he has spoken to us, and to our judges, who have judged Israel, and to our kings, and to our leaders, and to all Israel and Judah
    2: And so the Lord has brought upon us great evils, such as never before happened under heaven, (but which have come to pass in Jerusalem according to what was written in the law of Moses
    3: even that a man would eat the flesh of his son and the flesh of his daughter
    4: And so he placed them under the hand of all the kings who surround us, in disgrace and desolation among all the people where the Lord has scattered us
    5: And we were brought down low and were not raised up, because we sinned against the Lord our God, by not obeying his voice
    6: To the Lord our God is justice, but to us and to our fathers is confusion of face, just as on this day
    7: For the Lord has pronounced against us all these evils, which have overcome us
    8: And we have not beseeched the face of the Lord our God, so that we might return, each one of us from our most sinful ways
    9: And the Lord has watched over us for evil and has brought it upon us, because the Lord is just in all his works that he has commanded us
    10: and we have not listened to his own voice, so as to walk according to the teachings of the Lord, which he has set before our face
    11: And now, O Lord God of Israel, who has led your people out of the land of Egypt with a strong hand, and with signs, and with wonders, and with your great power, and with an exalted arm, and has made a name for yourself, just as on this day
    12: we have sinned, we have become impious, we have acted unjustly, O Lord our God, against all your principles
    13: May your wrath be turned away from us because, having been forsaken, we are few among the irreligious where you have scattered us
    14: Heed, O Lord, our petitions and our prayers, and deliver us for your own sake, and grant that we may find favor before the face of those who have led us away
    15: so that all the earth may know that you are the Lord our God, and because your name has been invoked over Israel and over his posterity
    16: Gaze upon us, O Lord, from your holy home, and incline your ear, and heed us
    17: Open your eyes and see, because the dead, who are in the underworld, whose spirit has been taken away from their vital organs, will not give honor and justification to the Lord
    18: But the soul that is sorrowful for the greatness of evil, approaches bowed down and weak, and the failing eyes and the hungering soul give glory and justice to you, the Lord
    19: For it is not according to the righteousness of our fathers that we pour out our petitions and beg mercy in your sight, O Lord our God
    20: but because you have sent your wrath and your fury upon us, just as you have spoken by the hand of your children the prophets, saying
    21: “Thus says the Lord, ‘Bow down your shoulder and your neck, and do work for the king of Babylon, and settle in the land which I gave to your fathers
    22: because, if you will not listen to the voice of the Lord your God, to serve the king of Babylon, I will cause you to depart from the cities of Judah and from the gates of Jerusalem
    23: And I will take away from you the voice of cheerfulness and the voice of joy, and the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride, and all the land will be without any trace of its inhabitants.’ 
    24: And they did not listen to your voice, that they should serve the king of Babylon, and so you have fulfilled your words, which you spoke by the hands of your children the prophets, so that the bones of our kings and the bones of our fathers would be carried away from their place
    25: And, behold, they have been cast out into the heat of the sun and the frost of the night, and they have died by means of grievous evils, by famine, and by the sword, and by banishment
    26: And you have set up the temple, in which your name itself was called upon, just as it is on this day, because of the iniquity of the house of Israel and the house of Judah
    27: And you have accomplished in us, O Lord our God, according to all your goodness and according to all your great mercy
    28: just as you spoke by the hand of your child Moses, in the day when you commanded him to write your law before the sons of Israel
    29: saying: “If you will not listen to my voice, this great multitude will be changed into the least among the peoples, where I will scatter them
    30: For I know that the people will not listen to me, for the people are stiff necked. But they will have a change of their heart in the land of their captivity
    31: and they will know that I am the Lord their God. And I will give them a heart, and they will understand, ears, and they will hear
    32: And they will praise me in the land of their captivity, and will remember my name
    33: And they will turn themselves away from their stiff back, and from their wicked deeds, for they will call to mind the way of their fathers, who sinned against me
    34: And I will restore them to the land which I pledged to their fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and they will rule over it, and I will multiply them, and they will not be diminished
    35: And I will establish for them a new and everlasting covenant, so that I will be their God and they will be my people. And I will no longer move my people, the sons of Israel, out of the land which I have given them.

  Chapter 3.

    1: “ ‘And now, O Lord Almighty, the God of Israel, the soul in anguish and the troubled spirit cry out to you
    2: Listen, O Lord, and be merciful, for you are a merciful God, and so be merciful to us, for we have sinned before you
    3: For you are enthroned in eternity, but we will pass away in time
    4: O Lord Almighty, the God of Israel, listen now to the prayer of the dead of Israel and of their sons, who have sinned before you and have not listened to the voice of the Lord their God, and have joined themselves to evil
    5: Remember not the iniquities of our fathers, but remember your hand and your name at this time
    6: For you are the Lord our God, and we will praise you, O Lord
    7: And for this reason, you have imparted your fear into our hearts, and also, so that we may call upon your name and may praise you in our captivity, for we are converted from the iniquity of our fathers, who sinned before you
    8: And, behold, we are still in our captivity on this day, where you have scattered us into disgrace, and into slander, and into sin, according to all the iniquities of our fathers, who withdrew from you, O Lord our God
    9: Listen, O Israel, to the commandments of life! Pay attention, so that you may learn prudence
    10: How is it, O Israel, that you are in the land of your enemies
    11: that you have grown old in a foreign land, that you are defiled with the dead, that you are regarded as among those who are descending into hell
    12: You have forsaken the fountain of wisdom
    13: For if you had walked in the way of God, you would certainly have lived in everlasting peace
    14: Learn where prudence is, where virtue is, where understanding is, so that you may know at the same time where long life and prosperity are, where the light of the eyes and peace are
    15: Who has discovered its place? And who has entered its treasure chamber
    16: Where are the leaders of the peoples, and those who rule over the beasts that are upon the earth
    17: who play among the birds of the air
    18: who store up treasures of silver and gold, in which men trust, and with whom there is no end to their acquiring, who work with silver and are anxious about it, and whose works are inexplicable
    19: They have been banished and have descended to hell, and others are risen up in their place
    20: The youth have seen the light and have dwelt upon the earth, yet they are ignorant of the way of instruction
    21: They have neither understood the paths of it, nor have their sons accepted it. It is far from their face
    22: It has not been heard of in the land of Canaan, nor has it been seen in Teman
    23: It is likewise with the sons of Hagar, who search for the practicality that is of the earth, the negotiators of Merran and Teman, and the storytellers, and the searchers of discretion and intelligence. Yet the way of wisdom they have not known, nor have they called to mind its paths
    24: O Israel, how great is the house of God, and how vast is the place of his possession
    25: It is great and has no end! It is exalted and immense
    26: There were those who were called giants, who existed from the beginning, of great stature, expert in war
    27: The Lord did not choose them, nor did they discover the way of instruction; for this reason they perished
    28: and, because they did not have wisdom, they passed away as a result of their foolishness
    29: Who has gone up into heaven, and taken her, and brought her down from the clouds
    30: Who has crossed the sea, and found her, and brought her, chosen instead of gold
    31: There is no one who is able to know her ways, nor any who can search out her paths
    32: Yet he who knows the universe is familiar with her, and in his foresight he invented her, he who prepared the earth for time without end, and filled it with cattle and four-footed beasts
    33: who sends out the light, and it goes, and who summoned it, and it obeyed him in fear
    34: Yet the stars have given light from their posts, and they rejoiced
    35: They were called, and so they said, “Here we are,” and they shined with cheerfulness to him who made them
    36: This is our God, and no other can compare to him
    37: He invented the way of all instruction, and delivered it to Jacob his child, and to Israel his beloved
    38: After this, he was seen on earth, and he conversed with men

  Chapter 4.

    1: “ ‘This is the book of the commandments of God and of the law, which exists in eternity. All those who keep it will attain to life, but those who have forsaken it, to death
    2: Convert, O Jacob, and embrace it, walk in the way of its splendor, facing its light
    3: Do not surrender your glory to another, nor your value to a foreign people
    4: We have been happy, O Israel, because the things that are pleasing to God have been made clear to us
    5: Be ever more peaceful in soul, O people of God, the memorial of Israel
    6: You have been sold to the nations, not into destruction, but because of this, in resentment, you provoked God to wrath, and so you have been delivered to adversity
    7: For you have exasperated him who made you, the eternal God, by sacrificing to evil spirits, and not to God
    8: For you have forgotten God, who nurtured you, and you have saddened Jerusalem, your nurse
    9: For she saw the wrath of God approaching you, and she said, “Listen, region of Zion, for God has brought upon me great sorrow
    10: For I have seen the captivity of my people, my sons and daughters, which the Eternal has led over them
    11: For I nurtured them with joy, but I sent them away with weeping and sorrow
    12: Let no one rejoice over me, a widow and a desolation, for I am forsaken by many because of the sins of my sons, because they strayed from the law of God
    13: And they have not known his righteousness, nor walked in the ways of the commandments of God, nor have they advanced with justice along the paths of his truth
    14: Let the region of Zion approach, and remember the captivity of my sons and daughters, which the Eternal led over them
    15: For he has brought a far away people upon them, a guilty people, and of another language
    16: who have not reverenced the aged, nor had mercy on the children, and who have led away the beloved of the widow, leaving me deserted and alone, without sons
    17: But as for me, how am I able to help you
    18: For he who has brought these evils upon you, will rescue you from the hands of your enemies
    19: Walk on, sons, walk on, for I have been abandoned and I am alone
    20: I have taken off the garment of peace and have put on the sackcloth of supplication, and I will cry out to the most High in my days
    21: Be ever more peaceful, sons. Cry out to the Lord, and he will rescue you from the hand of the hostile leaders
    22: For I have placed my hope in your eternal salvation, and joy approaches me from the Holy One, over the mercy which will come to you by our eternal salvation
    23: For I sent you forth with sorrow and weeping, but the Lord will restore you to me with joy and gladness for eternity
    24: For just as the neighbors of Zion have seen your captivity from God, so also will they soon see your salvation from God, which will overcome you with great honor and eternal splendor
    25: Sons, endure patiently the wrath that has come upon you, for your enemy has persecuted you, but you will quickly see his destruction and you will climb over his neck
    26: My delicate ones have walked rough ways, for they were regarded as a flock torn apart by enemies
    27: Be ever more peaceful in soul, sons, and call out to the Lord, for you will be remembered by him who led you away
    28: For as much as you thought to go astray from God, ten times as much again he will require of you when converting
    29: For he who led you into evil, he himself will again lead you to eternal happiness with your salvation.
    30: Be ever more peaceful in soul, Jerusalem, for he who has named you, has been affected by you
    31: The criminals who have troubled you, will perish, and those who rejoiced in your ruin, will be punished
    32: The cities that your sons have served, will be punished, and also, she who received your sons
    33: For just as she was glad at your ruin, and she rejoiced in your fall, so also will she be grieved in her own desolation
    34: and the exaltation of her multitude will be cut off, and her gladness will be turned to sorrow
    35: For fire will overcome her from the Eternal for many days, and she will be inhabited by evil spirits for a long time
    36: Look around, Jerusalem, towards the east, and see the happiness that comes to you from God
    37: For behold, your sons approach, whom you sent away scattered. They approach, gathering together, from the east all the way to the west, at the word of the Holy One, rejoicing in the honor of God
