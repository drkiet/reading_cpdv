Day 128:

Reading Job, chapters ['13', '14', '15', '16']:

  Chapter 13.

    1: Behold, my eye has seen all these things, and my ear has heard, and I have understood each one
    2: In conformity with your knowledge, I also know. I am not inferior to you
    3: Yet I speak this way to the Almighty, and I desire to argue with God
    4: having first shown that you fabricate lies and cultivate perverse teachings
    5: And I wish that you would remain silent, so that you would be counted among the wise
    6: Therefore, listen to my correction, and pay attention to the judgment of my lips
    7: Does God require your lie, so that you would speak deceitfully for him
    8: Have you taken his place, and do you struggle to give judgment in favor of God
    9: Or, will it please him, from whom nothing can be concealed? Or, will he be deceived, like a man, by your deceitfulness
    10: He will accuse you because in secret you have preempted his presence
    11: As soon as he moves himself, he will disturb you, and his dread will fall over you
    12: Your remembrance will be compared to ashes, and your necks will be reduced to clay
    13: Be silent for a little while, so that I may speak whatever my mind suggests to me
    14: Why do I wound my flesh with my teeth, and carry my soul in my hands
    15: And now, if he would kill me, I will hope in him; in this, truly, I will correct my ways in his sight
    16: And he will be my savior, for no hypocrite at all will approach in his sight
    17: Listen to my words, and perceive an enigma with your ears
    18: If I will be judged, I know that I will be found to be just
    19: Who is it that will go to judgment with me? Let him approach. Why should I be consumed in silence
    20: Do not do such things to me twice, and then I will not hide from your face
    21: Take your hand far away from me, and do not let your dread terrify me
    22: Call me, and I will answer you, or else I will speak, and you can answer me
    23: How many iniquities and sins do I have? Reveal my crimes and offenses to me
    24: Why do you conceal your face and consider me to be your enemy
    25: Against a leaf, which is carried away by the wind, you reveal your power, and you pursue dry straw
    26: For you write bitter things against me, and you want to consume me for the sins of my youth
    27: You have put my feet on a tether, and you have observed all my paths, and you have considered the steps of my feet
    28: I will be left to decay like something rotten and like a garment that is being eaten by moths

  Chapter 14.

    1: Man, born of woman, living for a short time, is filled with many miseries
    2: He comes forth like a flower, and is crushed, and he flees, as if a shadow, and never remains in the same state
    3: And do you consider it fitting to look down with your eyes on someone in this way and to lead him into judgment with you
    4: Who can make him clean who is conceived of unclean seed? Are you not the only one who can
    5: The days of man are short, and the number of his months is with you; you have determined his limits, which cannot be surpassed
    6: Withdraw a little from him, so that he may rest, until his awaited day arrives, like that of the hired hand
    7: A tree has hope: if it has been cut, it turns green again, and its branches spring forth
    8: If its roots grow old in the earth, and its trunk passes into dust
    9: at the scent of water, it will sprout and bring forth leaves, as when it had first been planted
    10: Truly, when a man dies, and has been left unprotected, and has decayed, I ask you where is he
    11: It is as if the waters had receded from the sea and an emptied river had dried up
    12: just so, when a man is fallen asleep, he will not rise again, until the heavens are worn away; he will not awaken, nor rise from his sleep
    13: Who will grant this to me, that you will protect me in the underworld, and hide me until your fury passes by, and establish a time for me, in which you will remember me
    14: Do you suppose that a dead man will live again? On each of the days in which I now battle, I wait until my transformation occurs
    15: You will call me and I will answer you; to the work of your hands, you will extend your right hand
    16: Indeed, you have numbered my steps, but you have been lenient with my sins
    17: You have sealed up my offenses, as if in a purse, but you have cured my iniquity
    18: A falling mountain flows away, and a stone is transferred from its place
    19: Waters wear away stones, and with a flood the land is reduced little by little; and similarly, you will destroy man
    20: You have strengthened him for a little while, so that he may cross over into eternity. You will change his face and send him forth
    21: Whether his sons have been noble or ignoble, he will not understand
    22: And in this way his body, while he yet lives, will have grief, and his soul will mourn over himself

  Chapter 15.

    1: But Eliphaz the Themanite, answering, said
    2: Will a wise man answer as if he were speaking wind, and will he fill his stomach with fire
    3: You rebuke with words he who is not equal to you, and you speak what is not expedient for you
    4: to such an extent that, within yourself, you have expelled reverence and have taken away prayers from the presence of God
    5: For your iniquity has mislead your mouth, and you imitate the tongue of blasphemers
    6: Your own mouth will condemn you, not I; and your own lips will answer you
    7: Are you the first man who was born, or were you formed before the hills
    8: Have you heard the intentions of God, and will his wisdom be inferior to you
    9: What do you know, about which we are ignorant? What do you understand that we do not know
    10: There are with us both aged and ancient men, even more senior than your fathers
    11: Is it so important that God should console you? But your own depraved words prevent this
    12: Why does your heart exalt you, and why do you gaze with your eyes, as if thinking great things
    13: Why does your spirit stir against God, so as to utter such speeches from your mouth
    14: What is man that he should be immaculate, and that he should appear just, having been born of woman
    15: Behold, among his holy ones not one is immutable, and even the heavens are not pure in his sight
    16: How much more abominable and useless is the man who drinks as if from the water of iniquity
    17: I will reveal to you, so listen to me; and I will explain to you what I have seen
    18: The wise acknowledge, and they do not leave behind, their fathers
    19: to whom alone the earth has been given, and no stranger passed among them
    20: The impious is arrogant for all his days, and the number of the years of his tyranny is uncertain
    21: The sound of terror is always in his ears; and when there is peace, he always suspects treason
    22: He does not believe that it is possible for him to be turned from darkness into the light, for he sees around him the sword on every side
    23: When he moves himself to seek bread, he knows that the day of darkness has been prepared for his hand
    24: Tribulation will terrify him, and anguish will prevail over him, like a king who is being prepared to go to battle
    25: For he has extended his hand against God, and he has strengthened himself against the Almighty
    26: He has rushed against him with his throat exposed, and he has been armed with a fat neck
    27: Thickness has covered his face, and lard hangs down from his sides
    28: He has lived in desolate cities and deserted houses, which have been turned into tombs
    29: He will not be enriched, nor will his basic necessities endure, nor will he establish his root in the earth
    30: He will not withdraw from the darkness; the flame will burn up his branches, and he will be defeated by the breath of his own mouth
    31: He will not believe, being vainly deceived by error, that he could be redeemed at any price
    32: Before his time is completed, he will pass into ruin and his hands will wither away
    33: He will be wounded like a grapevine, when its cluster is in first flower, and like an olive tree that casts off its flower
    34: For the congregation of the hypocrites is fruitless, and fire will devour the tabernacles of those who love to accept money
    35: He has conceived sorrow, and he has brought forth iniquity, and his womb prepares deceit

  Chapter 16.

    1: Then Job, answering, said
    2: I have often heard such things; you are all aggravating comforters
    3: Will there be no end to windy words? Or is it at all a burden to you, if you speak
    4: I, too, can speak like you; and I also wish that your soul favored my soul
    5: I would also comfort you with speeches and would wag my head over you
    6: I would strengthen you with my mouth, and would move my lips, as if being lenient to you
    7: But what can I do? When I am speaking, my grief will not be quiet; and if I am quiet, it will not withdraw from me
    8: But now my grief has crushed me, and all my limbs have been reduced to nothing
    9: My wrinkles bear witness against me, and a liar rises up against my face, contradicting me
    10: He has gathered together his fury towards me, and, threatening me, he has roared against me with his teeth; my enemy has beheld me with terrible eyes
    11: They have opened their mouths against me, and, reproaching me, they have struck me on the cheek; they are nourished by my sufferings
    12: God has confined me with the immoral, and he has delivered me into the hands of the impious
    13: I, who once was wealthy, am now crushed. He has grabbed me by my neck; he has broken me and has placed me before him as a sign
    14: He has surrounded me with his lances. He has severely wounded my lower back, he has not been lenient, and he has poured out my organs upon the earth
    15: He has cut me with wound after wound. He has rushed upon me like a giant
    16: I have sewn sackcloth over my skin, and I have covered my body with ashes
    17: My face is swollen from weeping, and my eyelids have dimmed my vision
    18: These things I have endured without iniquity in my hand, while I held pure prayers before God
    19: O earth, do not conceal my blood, nor let my outcry find a hiding place in you
    20: For behold, my witness is in heaven, and my confidante is on high
    21: My friends are full of words; my eye rains tears upon God
    22: And I wish that a man might be so judged before God, just as the son of man is judged with his assistant
    23: For behold, a few years pass by, and I am walking a path by which I will not return
