Day 131:

Reading Job, chapters ['25', '26', '27', '28']:

  Chapter 25.

    1: Then Baldad the Suhite answered by saying
    2: Power and terror are with him that makes a pact with those in high places
    3: Is there any limit to the number of his soldiers or to the number of those over whom his light rises
    4: Is it right for man to compare himself to God, or to appear pure though he is born of woman
    5: Behold, even the moon is not radiant, and the stars are not pure, in his sight
    6: Is man much more than rottenness and the son of man much more than worms

  Chapter 26.

    1: Then Job responded by saying
    2: Whose assistant are you? Is he weak-minded? And do you sustain the arm of him that is not strong
    3: To whom have you given advice? Perhaps it is to him that has no wisdom or prudence that you have revealed your many ideas
    4: Who is it that you wanted to teach? Was it not him that created the breath of life
    5: Behold, giant things groan under the waters, and they dwell with them
    6: The underworld is naked before him, and there is no covering for perdition
    7: He stretched out the North over emptiness, and he suspended the land over nothing
    8: He secures the waters in his clouds, so that they do not burst forth downward all at once
    9: He holds back the face of his throne, and he stretches his cloud over it
    10: He has set limits around the waters, until light and darkness shall reach their limit
    11: The pillars of heaven tremble and are frightened at his nod
    12: By his strength, the seas suddenly gather together, and his foresight has struck the arrogant
    13: His spirit has adorned the heavens, and his birthing hand has brought forth the winding serpent
    14: Behold, these things have been said about his ways in part, and, since we barely have heard a small drop of his word, who will be able to gaze upon the thunder of his greatness

  Chapter 27.

    1: Job also added to this, using figures of speech, and he said
    2: As God lives, who has taken away my judgment, and the Almighty, who has led my soul to bitterness
    3: as long as my breath remains in me and the breath of God remains in my nostrils
    4: my lips will not speak iniquity, nor will my tongue devise lies
    5: Far be it from me that I should judge you to be right, for, until I expire, I will not withdraw from my innocence
    6: I will not forsake my justification, which I have just begun to grasp, for my heart does not find blame for me in my whole life
    7: Let the impious be as my enemy, and the sinful, as my adversary
    8: For what hope is there for the hypocrite, if he greedily plunders and God does not free his soul
    9: Will God pay attention to his cry, when anguish overcomes him
    10: Or will he take delight in the Almighty and call upon God at all times
    11: I will teach you through the hand of God, what the Almighty holds, and I will not conceal it
    12: Behold, you know all this, and so why do you speak vain things without a reason
    13: This is the portion of the impious man with God, and the inheritance of the violent, which they will receive from the Almighty
    14: If his sons should happen to increase, they will be for the sword, and his grandsons will not be satisfied with bread
    15: Whatever will remain of him will be buried in the ruins, and his widows will not weep
    16: If he will amass silver as if it were dirt and fabricate garments as if they were clay
    17: then yes, he will gather, but the just will be clothed with it and the innocent will divide the silver
    18: He has built his house like a moth, and he has made a makeshift shelter like a sentry
    19: When he falls asleep, the rich man will leave him with nothing; he will open his eyes and find nothing
    20: Destitution will surround him like water; a storm will overwhelm him in the night
    21: A burning wind will pick him up and carry him away, and, like a whirlwind, it will rush him from his place
    22: And it will hurl over him and will not spare him; fleeing from its power, he will go into exile
    23: He will clasp his hands over himself, and he will hiss at himself, while considering his situation

  Chapter 28.

    1: Silver has its fissures where it is first found, and gold has a place where it is melted
    2: Iron is taken from the earth, and ore, unbound by heat, is turned into brass
    3: He has established a time for darkness, and he has settled on an end for all things, as well as for the stone that is in the gloom and shadow of death
    4: The burning separates a pilgrim people from those who have been forgotten by the feet of the destitute man and from the unapproachable
    5: The land, where bread appeared in its place, has been destroyed by fire
    6: Its stones are embedded with sapphires, and its soil, with gold
    7: The bird does not know its path, nor has the eye of the vulture beheld it
    8: The sons of merchants have not walked there, nor has the lioness traveled through it
    9: He has stretched out his hand to the rocks; he has overturned the foundations of the mountains
    10: He has cut rivers through the rocks, and his eye has seen all precious things
    11: The depths of rivers he has also examined, and he has brought hidden things into the light
    12: But, in truth, where is wisdom to be found, and where is the place of understanding
    13: Man does not know its price, nor is it found in the land of those who live in sweetness
    14: The abyss declares, “It is not in me.” And the sea says, “It is not with me.
    15: The finest gold will not be paid for it, nor will silver be weighed in exchange for it
    16: It will not be compared with the dyed colors of India, nor with the very costly stone sardonyx, nor with the sapphire
    17: Neither gold nor crystal will be its equal; neither will vessels of gold be fitted for it
    18: The exalted and the eminent will not be remembered in comparison with it. Yet wisdom is drawn out of concealment
    19: The topaz of Ethiopia will not be equal to it, nor will it be compared to the purest dyes
    20: So then, where does wisdom begin, and where is the place of understanding
    21: It has been hidden from the eyes of all living things, just as the birds of the heavens escape notice
    22: Perdition and death have said, “With our ears, we have heard its fame.
    23: God understands its way, and he knows its location
    24: For he beholds the limits of the world, and he looks upon all things that are under heaven
    25: He created a counterweight for the winds, and he suspended the waters to measure them
    26: At that time, he gave a law to the rain and a path to the resounding storms
    27: Then he saw and explained it, and he made ready and examined it
    28: And he said to man, “Behold the fear of the Lord. Such is wisdom. And to withdraw from evil, this is understanding.
