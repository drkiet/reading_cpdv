Day 189:

Reading Wisdom, chapters ['9', '10', '11', '12']:

  Chapter 9.

    1: “God of my fathers and Lord of mercy, who has made all things with your word
    2: and by your wisdom has established man to have dominion over the creatures which have been made by you
    3: so that he would order the world in equity and justice, and execute judgment with an upright heart
    4: give me wisdom, the handmaiden at your throne, and be unwilling to reject me from among your children
    5: because I am your servant, and the son of your handmaid, a weak man, and short-lived, with limited understanding of judgment and laws
    6: And if someone were perfect among the sons of men, yet if your wisdom was taken away from him, he would be counted as nothing
    7: You have chosen me to be a king of your people, and a judge of your sons and daughters
    8: And you called me to construct a temple on your holy mount, and, in the city of your dwelling, an altar in the likeness of your holy tabernacle, which you have prepared from the beginning
    9: And with you is wisdom, who is familiar with your works, and who was nearby when you made the world, and who knows what is pleasing to your eyes, and who is guided by your teachings
    10: Send her out of your holy heavens and from the throne of your majesty, so that she is with me and labors with me, and I will know what is acceptable with you
    11: For she knows and understands all things, and will lead me soberly in my works, and will guard me by her power
    12: And my works will be acceptable, and I will govern your people justly, and I will be worthy of the throne of my father
    13: For who among men can know the counsel of God? Or who can imagine the will of God
    14: For the thoughts of mortals are timid, and our foresight is uncertain
    15: For the corruptible body weighs down the soul, and this earthy dwelling presses many thoughts upon the mind
    16: And we assess with difficulty the things that are of earth, and we discover with labor the things that are within our view. So who will search out the things that are in heaven
    17: Moreover, who will know your mind, unless you give wisdom and send your holy spirit from on high
    18: And in this way, those who are on earth are corrected in their path, and men learn the things that are pleasing to you
    19: For by wisdom they are saved, who have pleased you, O Lord, from the beginning.

  Chapter 10.

    1: This is he, who was formed first by God, the father of the world, who was alone when created; she preserved him
    2: and led him out of his offense, and gave him the power to maintain all things
    3: After this, when the unjust man withdrew from her in his anger, he perished through anger by the murder of his brother
    4: Because of this, when water destroyed the earth, wisdom healed it again, guiding the just by means of contemptible wood
    5: Moreover, when the nations had conspired together to consent to wickedness, she knew the just, and preserved him without blame before God, and preserved his strength out of mercy for his sons
    6: She freed this just man from the destruction of the impious, fleeing descending fire in the Five Cities
    7: which, as a testimony to their wickedness, is a constantly smoking desolate land, and the trees bear fruit at uncertain times, and a figure of salt stands as a monument to an unbelieving soul
    8: For, in disregarding wisdom, they are fallen, not so much in this, that they were ignorant of good, but that they bequeathed to men a memorial of their foolishness, so that, in the things in which they sinned, they were unable to escape notice
    9: Yet wisdom has freed from sorrow those who are self-observant
    10: She led the just man, this fugitive of his brother’s wrath, by the right ways, and revealed to him the kingdom of God, and gave him the knowledge of holiness, honored him in his labors, and completed his labors
    11: In the midst of encircling deceit, she flowed around him and made him honest
    12: She guarded him from his enemies, and she defended him from seducers, and she gave him a strong conflict so that he might overcome and might know that the power of all things is wisdom
    13: She did not abandon the just man when he was sold, but freed him from sinners; she went down with him into the pit
    14: and she did not abandon him in chains, while she brought him the scepter of the kingdom and power against those who oppressed him, and revealed them to be liars who had dishonored him, and gave him everlasting glory
    15: She freed this just people and the blameless offspring, from the nations that had oppressed them
    16: She entered the soul of the servant of God and stood against dreadful kings in the midst of portents and signs
    17: and she rendered to the just the wages of their labors, and led them along a wondrous way; and she was to them, like a cover by day, and like the light of the stars by night
    18: She carried them through the Red Sea, and led them across a great water
    19: But their enemies, she submerged in the sea, and from the furthest depths, she drew them up. Therefore, the just carried off the spoils of the impious
    20: And they chanted to your holy name, Lord, and they together praised your victorious hand
    21: because wisdom opened the mouth of the mute, and made the speech of infants eloquent

  Chapter 11.

    1: She directed their works in the hands of the holy prophet
    2: They made a path through desolate areas, which were uninhabited, and set up their homes in remote places
    3: They stood firm against the enemy, and vindicated themselves from their adversaries
    4: They thirsted, and they called upon you, and water was given them out of the deepest rock, and respite from thirst out of the hard stone
    5: For through water, their enemies had been punished, by the corruption of their drinking water; and so, among them, when the sons of Israel lacked the abundance they would have had, their enemies rejoiced
    6: yet through water, when they were in need, it turned out well for them
    7: For instead of a fountain, even everlasting in flow, you gave human blood to the unjust
    8: and while they would be crushed into disgrace because of the murdering of infants, you unexpectedly gave your own abundant water
    9: revealing through the thirst, which occurred at that time, how you would exalt your own and would kill their adversaries
    10: For when they were being tested, and even when receiving merciful correction, they knew in what way, when your wrath judged the impious, they would suffer torments
    11: For these, advising like a father, you approved; but the others, interrogating like a severe king, you condemned
    12: For whether absent or present, they were tortured alike
    13: For they had received double:  weariness and groaning in the remembrance of things past
    14: For when they paid attention to their punishments, to attend to their own benefit, they called to mind the Lord, admiring the end result
    15: For though they showed scorn by throwing out distorted statements, in the end they were amazed at the result, but this is not the same as thirsting for justice
    16: For according to the thinking of their irrational iniquity, because some, going astray, were worshiping mute serpents and worthless beasts, you sent upon them a multitude of mute beasts for vengeance
    17: so that they might know that by whatever things a man sins, by the same also is he tormented
    18: For it was not impossible for your all-powerful hand, which created the world from unknown material, to send forth upon them a multitude of bears, or fierce lions
    19: or, in anger, beasts of a new kind, massive and strange, either breathing out a fiery vapor, or sending forth an odorous smoke, or shooting horrible sparks from their eyes
    20: whereby, not only wounds would be able to destroy them, but also the very sight would kill them through fear
    21: Yet, even without these, they could have been killed with one breath, suffering persecution of their own making and being scattered by your spirit of virtue; but you have ordered all things in size and number and weight
    22: Though many are strong, you alone always overcome. And who will withstand the strength of your arm
    23: For, like a tiny grain on a scale, just so is the world before you, and like a drop of dew before dawn, which descends upon the earth
    24: But you are merciful to all, because you can do all, and you dismiss the sins of man because of repentance
    25: For you love all things that are, and you hate nothing of the things you have made; for you would not have created or established anything that you hated
    26: For how could anything endure, except by your will? Or what, having been called by you not to exist, would be preserved
    27: Yet you spare all things, because they are yours, O Lord, who loves souls

  Chapter 12.

    1: O how good and gracious, Lord, is your spirit in all things
    2: Therefore, those who wander afield, you correct, and, as to those who sin, you counsel them and admonish them, so that, having abandoned malice, they may believe in you, O Lord
    3: For those ancient inhabitants of your holy land, who you abhorred
    4: because they were doing works hateful to you, through unjust medicines and sacrifices
    5: and the merciless murderers of their own sons, and the eaters of human entrails, and the devourers of blood apart from your community sacrament
    6: and the sellers performing the ceremonies of helpless souls, you willed to destroy by the hands of our parents
    7: so that they might worthily secure the sojourn of the children of God, in the land which is most beloved by you
    8: Yet, so that you were lenient even to these men, you sent wasps, forerunners of your army, so that you might destroy them little by little
    9: not because you were unable to subdue the impious under the just by war or by cruel beasts, or with a harsh word to exterminate them at once
    10: but, in judging by degrees, you were giving them a place of repentance, not unaware that their nation is wicked, and their malice is inherent, and that their thinking could never be changed
    11: For this offspring was accursed from the beginning. Neither did you, fearing anyone, give favor to their sins
    12: For who will say to you, “What have you done?” Or who will stand against your judgment? Or who will come before you as a defender of unfair men? Or who will accuse you, if the nations perish, which you have made
    13: For neither is there any other God but you, who has care of all, to whom you would show that you did not give judgment unjustly
    14: Neither will king or tyrant inquire before you about those whom you destroyed
    15: Therefore, since you are just, you order all things justly, considering it foreign to your virtue to condemn him who does not deserve to be punished
    16: For your power is the beginning of justice, and, because you are Lord of all, you make yourself to be lenient to all
    17: For you reveal power to those who do not believe you to be perfect in power, and you expose the arrogance of those who do not know you
    18: Yet, you are the master of power, since you judge with tranquility, and since you administer us with great reverence; for it is close to you to be used whenever you will
    19: But you have taught your people, through such works, that they must be just and humane, and you have made your sons to be of good hope, because in judging you provide a place for repentance from sins
    20: For even if the enemies of your servants were deserving of death, you afflicted them with great attentiveness, providing a time and a place whereby they would be able to be changed from malice
    21: with what diligence, then, have you judged your sons, whose parents you have given oaths and covenants in good faith
    22: Therefore, while you give us discipline, you give our enemies a multiplicity of scourges, so that in judging we may think on your goodness, and when we are judged, we may hope for mercy
    23: Therefore, also to these, who have lived their life irrationally and unjustly, through these things that they worshiped, you gave the greatest torments
    24: And, indeed, they wandered for a long time in the way of error, valuing those things as gods, which are worthless even among animals, living in foolish irrational behavior
    25: Because of this, you have given a judgment in derision, as if from foolish children
    26: But those who have not been corrected by mockery and chiding, have experienced a judgment worthy of God
    27: For among those who were indignant at their sufferings, which came through those things that they reputed to be gods, when they saw that they would be destroyed by these same things, those who formerly refused knowledge of him, now acknowledged the true God, and, because of this, the end of their condemnation came upon them
