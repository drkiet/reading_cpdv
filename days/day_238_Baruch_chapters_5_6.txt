Day 238:

Reading Baruch, chapters ['5', '6']:

  Chapter 5.

    1: “ ‘Take off, O Jerusalem, the garment of your sorrow and troubles, and put on your beauty and the honor of that eternal glory, which you have from God
    2: God will surround you with a double garment of justice, and he will set a crown on your head of everlasting honor
    3: For God will reveal his splendor in you to all who are under heaven
    4: For your name will be given to you by God for eternity:  the peace of justice and the honor of piety
    5: Arise, O Jerusalem, and stand in exaltation, and look around towards the east, and see your sons, gathering together, from the rising of the sun to the setting of the sun, by the word of the Holy One, rejoicing in the remembrance of God
    6: For they went out from you on foot, led by the enemies, but the Lord will lead them to you, being carried in honor like sons of the kingdom
    7: For God has resolved to humble every high mountain and the longstanding cliffs, and to fill up the steep valleys in order to level the ground, so that Israel may walk diligently in the honor of God
    8: Yet the woods and every sweet-smelling tree have provided shade for Israel by the commandment of God
    9: For God will lead Israel with joy into the light of his majesty, with mercy and justice, which is from him.’ 

  Chapter 6.

    1: This is a copy of the letter that Jeremiah sent to those who would be taken captive into Babylon by the king of Babylon, so as to prophesy to them according to the warning he had received about them from God. “Because of the sins which you have sinned before God, you will be carried away into the captivity of Babylon by Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon
    2: And so, having been taken into Babylon, you will be there many years and for a long time, even to seven generations, yet after this, I will lead you away from there with peace
    3: But now, you will see in Babylon gods of gold and of silver, and of stone and of wood, carried upon shoulders, an awful display for the peoples
    4: See to it, then, that you do not in effect become like these strangers and become afraid, so that in awe you would be carried away into their midst
    5: And so, seeing the turmoil, behind you and in front of you, as they are worshiping, say in your hearts, ‘You ought to be adored, O Lord.
    6: For my angel is with you. And I myself will examine your souls
    7: For their tongue is polished by the craftsman, and they themselves are even inlaid with gold and silver, yet they are false and unable to speak
    8: And, just like a virgin who loves to decorate herself, so do they take up gold and make designs with it
    9: Their gods have crowns of certified gold upon their heads, from which the priests subtract gold and silver, and spend it on themselves
    10: Moreover, they even give from it to prostitutes, and use it to adorn kept women, and when they receive it back from the kept women, they use it to adorn their gods
    11: But these cannot be freed from rust and moths
    12: Although they are covered with a purple garment, they must wipe off their face, because of the dust of the house, which is very great around them
    13: Yet he who holds a scepter like a man, like the judge of the region, cannot put to death one who sins against him
    14: And though he holds in his hand a sword and an axe, yet he cannot free himself from war and robbers.  From this let it be known to you that they are not gods
    15: Therefore, do not fear them. For just as the vessel a man uses becomes useless when broken, so also are their gods
    16: When they are set up in a house, their eyes are full of dust from the feet of those who enter
    17: And like one who has offended the king and is surrounded at every door, or like a corpse about to be carried to the grave, so do the priests secure the doors with bars and locks, lest they be plundered by robbers
    18: They light candles to them, and in great number, and still they are unable to see, for they are like logs in the house
    19: It is truly said that the creeping things, which are of the earth, gnaw their hearts, and yet when these devour them and their garments, they do not feel it
    20: Their faces are made black by the smoke that is made in the house
    21: Over their bodies and over their heads fly owls and swallows and birds, and similarly, even cats
    22: From this you should understand that they are not gods. Therefore, neither should you fear them
    23: Furthermore, the gold which they have is shiny, but unless someone wipes off the rust, they will not shine. And even when they were molten, they did not feel it
    24: They acquire all kinds of costly things, yet there is no breath in them
    25: Without feet, they are carried upon shoulders, showing their unworthiness to all men. And so, may those who worship them be confounded
    26: Because of this, if they fall to the ground, they do not get up by themselves; and if someone sets it upright, they will not stand firm on their own; yet, just like the dead, offerings are placed next to them
    27: The priests themselves sell their sacrifices, and they spend it wastefully; and, in like manner, their wives take part of it, never sharing anything with the sick or the beggars
    28: Fertile and menstruous women contaminate their sacrifices. And so, knowing from this that they are not gods, you should not fear them
    29: For what reason are they called gods? It is because the women serve before the gods of silver and gold and wood
    30: and the priests sit in their houses, with torn garments, and their heads and beards shaven, and nothing on their heads
    31: But they roar, shouting out to their gods, just as at a feast for the dead
    32: The priests take away the garments of their gods, and clothe their wives and their sons
    33: And whether they endure evil from someone, or good, they are not able to repay it. They can neither establish a king, nor remove him
    34: Similarly, they can neither give riches, nor avenge evil. If anyone makes a vow to them, and does not keep it, they cannot require it
    35: They cannot free a man from death, nor rescue the weak from the strong
    36: They cannot restore sight to the blind, nor free a man from need
    37: They will not have mercy on the widow, nor do good to orphans
    38: Their gods of wood, and of stone, and of gold, and of silver, are like stones from the mountain; and those who worship them will be confounded
    39: In what way, then, is it to be supposed or said that they are gods
    40: For even the Chaldeans themselves do not honor these, who, when they hear about a mute, unable to speak, they offer him to Bel, asking from him that he may speak
    41: as if these, who are unable to move, would be able to perceive. And even they themselves, when they shall understand this, will abandon them, for, having come to their senses, they do not consider them to be gods
    42: Yet the women, wrapped in cords, sit by the roads, burning olive-stones
    43: And when any one of them, having been attracted by someone passing by, would sleep with him, she reproaches her neighbor because she was not found worthy, as she was, nor was her cord broken
    44: But all things that occur with them are false; in what way, then, is it to be considered or said that they are gods
    45: Yet they have been made by the workmen and the goldsmiths. They will be nothing else but what the priests want them to be
    46: For the artisans themselves, who make them, do not exist for a long time. So then, can these things, which have been made by them, be gods
    47: Yet they have bequeathed falsehoods and disgrace after this to the future
    48: For when they are overcome by battle or evil, the priests consider among themselves where they may hide themselves with them
    49: Therefore, why would they be perceived to be gods, who can neither free themselves from war, nor rescue themselves from evils
    50: For, in as much as they are only wood, inlaid with gold and silver, so let it be known henceforth, by all nations and kings, that they are false; because it has been revealed that they are not gods, but the work of men’s hands, and there is no work of God in them
    51: For this reason, then, it has been accepted that they are not gods, but are works of the hands of men, and no work of God is in them
    52: They have not raised up a king in the region, nor will they give rain to men
    53: They will not discern a judgment for anyone, nor will they free a region from injury, because they can do nothing, like crows in the middle of heaven and earth
    54: And, indeed, when there happens to be a fire in the house of these gods of wood, silver, and gold, the priests will certainly run away and save themselves, but these will truly be burned up like logs in the midst of it
    55: Yet they cannot withstand a king and war. In what way, then, is it to be considered or accepted that they are gods
    56: These gods of wood and stone, inlaid with gold and silver, can free themselves neither from thieves nor from robbers; whoever is stronger than they are
    57: will take up these things, the gold and the silver, and the garments which cover them, and will get away; neither will they be able to help themselves
    58: Therefore, it is better to be a king displaying his power, or a useful vessel in a house, about which he who owns it will boast, or a door in the house, which keeps safe what is inside, than to be these gods of falsehood
    59: For the sun, and the moon, and the constellations, though they are brilliant and have been sent forth to be useful, are obedient
    60: Similarly, the lightning, when it appears and is evident, and, in like manner, the wind blowing in every region
    61: and the clouds, when God orders them to make their rounds over the whole world, each carries out what was commanded
    62: Furthermore, the fire, having been sent from above so that it may consume mountains and woods, does what it has been instructed to do. Yet these are not similar, neither in splendor, nor in power, to any one of them
    63: From this, it should neither be supposed, nor said, that they are gods; since they are neither able to give judgment, nor to accomplish anything for men
    64: And so, knowing that they are not gods, therefore, have no fear of them
    65: For they can neither curse kings, nor bless them
    66: Besides, they show no signs in heaven to the nations; they neither shine like the sun, nor give light like the moon
    67: Beasts are better than they are, for they can flee under a covering, and so protect themselves
    68: Therefore, in no way is it clear to us that they are gods; because of this, you should not fear them
    69: For just as a scarecrow in a cucumber field protects nothing, so are their gods of wood, and silver, and inlaid gold
    70: They are just the same as a white thorn in a garden, on which all the birds sit; they are even like a corpse thrown out into the darkness, just so are these gods of wood, and inlaid gold, and inlaid silver
    71: By the purple, and likewise the Royal purple, moth-eaten garments upon them, you will then know that they are not gods. And finally, they themselves are consumed and will be a disgrace in the region
    72: Better is the just man who has no such images, for he will be far from disgrace.
