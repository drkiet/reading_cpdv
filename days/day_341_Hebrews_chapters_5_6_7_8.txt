Day 341:

Reading Hebrews, chapters ['5', '6', '7', '8']:

  Chapter 5.

    1: For every high priest, having been taken from among men, is appointed on behalf of men toward the things which pertain to God, so that he may offer gifts and sacrifices on behalf of sins
    2: he is able to commiserate with those who are ignorant and who wander astray, because he himself is also encompassed by infirmity
    3: And because of this, he also must make such offerings for sins even for himself, in the same manner as for the people
    4: Neither does anyone take up this honor himself, but rather he who is called by God, just as Aaron was
    5: Thus, even Christ did not glorify himself, so as to become High Priest, but instead, it was God who said to him: “You are my Son. Today I have begotten you.
    6: And similarly, he says in another place: “You are a priest forever, according to the order of Melchizedek.
    7: It is Christ who, in the days of his flesh, with a strong cry and tears, offered prayers and supplications to the One who was able to save him from death, and who was heard because of his reverence
    8: And although, certainly, he is the Son of God, he learned obedience by the things that he suffered
    9: And having reached his consummation, he was made, for all who are obedient to him, the cause of eternal salvation
    10: having been called by God to be the High Priest, according to the order of Melchizedek
    11: Our message about him is great, and difficult to explain when speaking, because you have been made feeble when listening
    12: For even though it is the time when you ought to be teachers, you are still lacking, so that you must be taught the things that are the basic elements of the Word of God, and so you have been made like those who are in need of milk, and not of solid food
    13: For anyone who is still feeding on milk is still unskillful in the Word of Justice; for he is like an infant
    14: But solid food is for those who are mature, for those who, by practice, have sharpened their mind, so as to discern good from evil

  Chapter 6.

    1: Therefore, interrupting an explanation of the basics of Christ, let us consider what is more advanced, not presenting again the fundamentals of repentance from dead works, and of faith toward God
    2: of the doctrine of baptism, and also of the imposition of hands, and of the resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment
    3: And we shall do this, if indeed God permits it
    4: For it is impossible for those who were once illuminated, and have even tasted of the heavenly gift, and have become sharers in the Holy Spirit
    5: who, despite having tasted the good Word of God and the virtues of the future age, have yet fallen away
    6: to be renewed again to penance, since they are crucifying again in themselves the Son of God and are still maintaining pretenses
    7: For the earth accepts a blessing from God, by drinking in the rain that often falls upon it, and by producing plants that are useful to those by whom it is cultivated
    8: But whatever brings forth thorns and briers is rejected, and is closest to what is accursed; their consummation is in combustion
    9: But from you, most beloved, we are confident that there will be things better and closer to salvation; even though we speak in this way
    10: For God is not unjust, such that he would forget your work and the love that you have shown in his name. For you have ministered, and you continue to minister, to the saints
    11: Yet we desire that each one of you display the same solicitude toward the fulfillment of hope, even unto the end
    12: so that you may not be slow to act, but instead may be imitators of those who, through faith and patience, shall inherit the promises
    13: For God, in making promises to Abraham, swore by himself, (because he had no one greater by whom he might swear)
    14: saying: “Blessing, I shall bless you, and multiplying, I shall multiply you.
    15: And in this way, by enduring patiently, he secured the promise
    16: For men swear by what is greater than themselves, and an oath as confirmation is the end of all their controversy
    17: In this matter, God, wanting to reveal more thoroughly the immutability of his counsel to the heirs of the promise, interposed an oath
    18: so that by two immutable things, in which it is impossible for God to lie, we may have the strongest solace: we who have fled together so as to hold fast to the hope set before us
    19: This we have as an anchor of the soul, safe and sound, which advances even to the interior of the veil
    20: to the place where the forerunner Jesus has entered on our behalf, so as to become the High Priest for eternity, according to the order of Melchizedek

  Chapter 7.

    1: For this Melchizedek, king of Salem, priest of the Most High God, met Abraham, as he was returning from the slaughter of the kings, and blessed him
    2: And Abraham divided to him a tenth part of everything. And in translation his name is first, indeed, king of justice, and next also king of Salem, that is, king of peace
    3: Without father, without mother, without genealogy, having neither beginning of days, nor end of life, he is thereby likened to the Son of God, who remains a priest continuously
    4: Next, consider how great this man is, since the Patriarch Abraham even gave tithes to him from the principal things
    5: And indeed, those who are from the sons of Levi, having received the priesthood, hold a commandment to take tithes from the people in accord with the law, that is, from their brothers, even though they also went forth from the loins of Abraham
    6: But this man, whose lineage is not enumerated with them, received tithes from Abraham, and he blessed even the one who held the promises
    7: Yet this is without any contradiction, for what is less should be blessed by what is better
    8: And certainly, here, men who receive tithes still die; but there, he bears witness that he lives
    9: And so it may be said that even Levi, who received tithes, was himself a tithe through Abraham
    10: For he was still in the loins of his father, when Melchizedek met him
    11: Therefore, if consummation had occurred through the Levitical priesthood (for under it the people received the law), then what further need would there be for another Priest to rise up according to the order of Melchizedek, one who was not called according to the order of Aaron
    12: For since the priesthood has been transferred, it is necessary that the law also be transferred
    13: For he about whom these things have been spoken is from another tribe, in which no one attends before the altar
    14: For it is evident that our Lord arose out of Judah, a tribe about which Moses said nothing concerning priests
    15: And yet it is far more evident that, according to the likeness of Melchizedek, there rises up another priest
    16: who was made, not according to the law of a carnal commandment, but according to the virtue of an indissoluble life
    17: For he testifies: “You are a priest forever, according to the order of Melchizedek.
    18: Certainly, there is a setting aside of the former commandment, because of its weakness and lack of usefulness
    19: For the law led no one to perfection, yet truly it introduced a better hope, through which we draw near to God
    20: Moreover, it is not without an oath. For certainly, the others were made priests without an oath
    21: But this man was made a priest with an oath, by the One who said to him: “The Lord has sworn and he will not repent. You are a priest forever.
    22: By so much, Jesus has been made the sponsor of a better testament
    23: And certainly, so many of the others became priests because, due to death, they were prohibited from continuing
    24: But this man, because he continues forever, has an everlasting priesthood
    25: And for this reason, he is able, continuously, to save those who approach God through him, since he is ever alive to make intercession on our behalf
    26: For it was fitting that we should have such a High Priest: holy, innocent, undefiled, set apart from sinners, and exalted higher than the heavens
    27: And he has no need, daily, in the manner of other priests, to offer sacrifices, first for his own sins, and then for those of the people. For he has done this once, by offering himself
    28: For the law appoints men as priests, though they have infirmities. But, by the word of the oath that is after the law, the Son has been perfected for eternity

  Chapter 8.

    1: Now the main point in the things that have been stated is this: that we have so great a High Priest, who is seated at the right hand of the throne of Majesty in the heavens
    2: who is the minister of holy things, and of the true tabernacle, which was established by the Lord, not by man
    3: For every high priest is appointed to offer gifts and sacrifices. Therefore, it is necessary for him also to have something to offer
    4: And so, if he were upon the earth, he would not be a priest, since there would be others to offer gifts according to the law
    5: gifts which serve as mere examples and shadows of the heavenly things. And so it was answered to Moses, when he was about to complete the tabernacle: “See to it,” he said, “that you make everything according to the example which was revealed to you on the mountain.
    6: But now he has been granted a better ministry, so much so that he is also the Mediator of a better testament, which has been confirmed by better promises
    7: For if the former one had been entirely without fault, then a place certainly would not have been sought for a subsequent one
    8: For, finding fault with them, he says: “Behold, the days shall arrive, says the Lord, when I will consummate a New Testament over the house of Israel and the house of Judah
    9: not according to the testament which I made with their fathers, on the day when I took them by the hand, so that I might lead them away from the land of Egypt. For they did not remain in my testament, and so I disregarded them, says the Lord
    10: For this is the testament which I will set before the house of Israel, after those days, says the Lord. I will instill my laws in their minds, and I will inscribe my laws on their hearts. And so, I will be their God, and they shall be my people
    11: And they will not teach, each one his neighbor, and each one his brother, saying: ‘Know the Lord.’ For all shall know me, from the least, even to the greatest of them
    12: For I will forgive their iniquities, and I will no longer remember their sins.
    13: Now in saying something new, he has made the former old. But that which decays and grows old is close to passing away
