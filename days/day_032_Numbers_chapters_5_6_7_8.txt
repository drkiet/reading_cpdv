Day 32:

Reading Numbers, chapters ['5', '6', '7', '8']:

  Chapter 5.

    1: And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying
    2: “Instruct the sons of Israel to cast out of the camp every leper, and those who have a flow of seed, and those who have been polluted because of the dead
    3: cast out of the camp both male and female, lest they contaminate it while I am dwelling with you.
    4: And the sons of Israel did so, and they cast them out, beyond the camp, just as the Lord had spoken to Moses
    5: And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying
    6: “Say to the sons of Israel: A man or a woman, when they have done anything out of all the sins that often befall men, or if, by negligence, they have transgressed the commandment of the Lord, and so have committed an offense
    7: they shall confess their sin, and they shall restore the principle itself, plus a fifth part above it, to any against whom they have sinned
    8: But if there would be no one to receive it, they shall give it to the Lord, and it shall be for the priest, except for the ram, which is offered for expiation, in order to be a pleasing victim
    9: Likewise, all the first-fruits, which the sons of Israel offer, belong to the priest
    10: with whatever is offered by each one at the Sanctuary, and which is delivered into the hands of the priest; it shall be his.
    11: And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying
    12: “Speak to the sons of Israel, and you shall say to them: The man whose wife will have gone astray, and, disdaining her husband
    13: will have slept with another man, and if her husband cannot discover it, but the adultery is secret, and if it cannot be proved by witnesses, because she was not caught in the shameful act
    14: if the spirit of jealousy stirs up the husband against his wife, who either has been polluted or is being assailed with a false suspicion
    15: he shall bring her to the priest, and he shall offer an oblation for her, a tenth part of native barley meal. He shall not pour oil over it, nor shall he place frankincense on it, because it is a sacrifice for jealousy, or an oblation investigating adultery
    16: Therefore, the priest shall offer it, and he shall set it in the sight of the Lord
    17: And he shall take up holy water in an earthen vessel, and he shall cast a little earth from the pavement of the tabernacle into it
    18: And while the woman stands before the Lord, he shall uncover her head, and he shall place over her hands the sacrifice of recollection and oblation of jealousy. But he shall take hold of the most bitter waters, in which he has gathered curses with loathing
    19: And he shall bind her by an oath, and he shall say: ‘If another man has not slept with you, and if you have not been polluted by forsaking the bed of your husband, these most bitter waters, into which I have gathered curses, shall not harm you
    20: But if you have turned away from your husband, and also have been defiled, and have lain together with another man
    21: these curses shall be thrown upon you: May the Lord turn you into a curse and an example among all his people. May he cause your thigh to rot, and may your abdomen swell up and burst out
    22: May the cursed waters enter into your stomach, and may your womb swell and your thigh rot.’ And the woman shall respond: ‘Amen, amen.
    23: And the priest shall write these curses in a little book, and then he shall erase them with the very bitter waters, into which he had gathered the curses
    24: and he shall give it to her to drink. And when she has emptied it
    25: the priest shall take from her hand the sacrifice of jealousy, and he shall elevate it before the Lord, and he shall impose it upon the altar. Yet only after he firs
    26: takes a handful of the sacrifice from that which is offered, and burns it upon the altar, and then he may give the most bitter waters to the woman as a drink
    27: And when she drinks it, if she has been defiled, and, having despised her husband, is guilty of adultery, the curse shall pass through her, and as her belly swells up, her thigh shall decay, and the woman shall become a curse and an example to all the people
    28: But if she has not been defiled, she shall be unharmed and she shall bear children
    29: This is the law for jealousy. If a woman has turned aside from her husband, and if she has been polluted
    30: and if the husband, being stirred up by the spirit of jealousy, has brought her before the sight of the Lord, and the priest has acted toward her according to all that has been written
    31: then the husband shall be without guilt, and she shall bear her iniquity.

  Chapter 6.

    1: And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying
    2: “Speak to the sons of Israel, and you shall say to them: A man or a woman, when they have made a vow so that they may be sanctified, and when they are willing to consecrate themselves to the Lord
    3: shall abstain from wine and from anything which is able to inebriate. They shall not drink vinegar made from wine or from any other drink, nor anything pressed from the grape. They shall not eat grapes, neither fresh nor dried
    4: During all the days that they are consecrated to the Lord by vow, they shall not eat whatever may be from the vineyard, from raisins, even to grape seeds
    5: During all the time of his separation, no razor shall pass over his head, even until the completion of the day when he is consecrated to the Lord. He shall be holy, letting the hair of his head grow long
    6: During all the time of his consecration, he shall not enter because of a death
    7: nor shall he contaminate himself, even over the funeral of his father, or his mother, or his brother, or his sister. For the consecration of his God is upon his head
    8: During all the days of his separation, he shall be holy to the Lord
    9: But if anyone will have died unexpectedly before him, the head of his consecration shall be polluted, and he shall shave it in that very place, on the same day of his purification, and again on the seventh day
    10: Then, on the eighth day, he shall offer two turtledoves or two young pigeons, to the priest at the entrance to the covenant of the testimony
    11: And the priest shall effect one for sin, and the other as a holocaust, and he shall pray for him, because he has sinned on account of the dead. And he shall sanctify his head on that day
    12: And he shall consecrate to the Lord the days of his separation, offering a one-year-old lamb for sin, yet in such a manner that the former days will be made null and void, because his sanctification was polluted
    13: This is the law of consecration. When the days that he had decreed by vow have been completed, he shall bring him to the door of the tabernacle of the covenant
    14: and he shall offer his oblation to the Lord: an immaculate one-year-old male lamb as a holocaust, and an immaculate one-year-old female lamb for sin, and an immaculate ram, a peace-offering victim
    15: also, a basket of unleavened bread, which has been sprinkled with oil, and cakes without leaven, anointed with oil, as well as the libations of each one
    16: And the priest shall offer them before the Lord, and he shall perform both the sin offering and the holocaust
    17: Yet truly, the ram he shall immolate as a peace-offering victim to the Lord, offering at the same time the basket of unleavened bread, and the libations which are required by custom
    18: Then the Nazarite shall be shaved of the long hair of his consecration, before the door of the tabernacle of the covenant. And he shall take his hair, and he shall place it upon the fire, which is under the sacrifice of the peace offerings
    19: And he shall take the cooked shoulder of the ram, and one twist of bread without leaven from the basket, and one unleavened cake, and he shall deliver them into the hands of the Nazarite, after his head has been shaven
    20: And receiving them again from him, he shall elevate them in the sight of the Lord. And having been sanctified, these shall be for the priest, as also the breast, which was ordered to be separated, and the leg. After this, the Nazarite is able to drink wine
    21: This is the law of the Nazarite, when he has vowed his oblation to the Lord in the time of his consecration, aside from those things which his hand shall find. According to what he had vowed in his mind, so shall he do, to the perfection of his sanctification.
    22: And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying
    23: “Say to Aaron and his sons: Thus shall you bless the sons of Israel, and you shall say to them
    24: ‘May the Lord bless you and keep you
    25: May the Lord reveal his face to you and take pity on you
    26: May the Lord turn his countenance toward you and grant peace to you.
    27: And they shall invoke my name over the sons of Israel, and I will bless them.

  Chapter 7.

    1: Now it happened in the day when Moses completed the tabernacle, and he set it up, and he anointed and sanctified it with all of its vessels, and similarly the altar and all of its vessels
    2: that the leaders of Israel and the heads of the families, who were in each tribe and who were in charge of those who had been numbered, offere
    3: their gifts in the sight of the Lord: six covered wagons with twelve oxen. Two leaders offered one wagon, and each offered one ox, and they offered these in the sight of the tabernacle

    5: “Receive these things from them, in order to serve in the ministry of the tabernacle, and you shall deliver them to the Levites, according to the order of their ministry.

    7: Two wagons and four oxen he gave to the sons of Gershon, according to what they needed
    8: The other four wagons and eight oxen he gave to the sons of Merari, according to their offices and service, under the hand of Ithamar, the son of Aaron the priest
    9: But to the sons of Kohath he gave no wagons or oxen, because they serve in the Sanctuary and they carry their burdens on their shoulders
    10: Therefore, the leaders offered, at the dedication of the altar on the day when it was anointed, their oblation before the altar

  Chapter 8.

    1: And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying
    2: “Speak to Aaron, and you shall say to him: When you place the seven lamps, let the lampstand be set up on the south side. Therefore, give this instruction: that the lamps should look out from the region opposite the north, toward the table of the bread of the presence; they shall give light opposite that area, toward the area that the lampstand faces.
    3: And Aaron did so, and he placed the lamps on the lampstand, just as the Lord had instructed Moses
    4: Now this was the workmanship of the lampstand: it was of ductile gold, both the main shaft and all that originated from both sides of the branches. According to the example that the Lord revealed to Moses, so did he make the lampstand
    5: And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying
    6: “Take the Levites from the midst of the sons of Israel, and you shall purify the
    7: according to this ritual: Let them be sprinkled with the water of illumination, and let them shave off all the hairs of their body. And when they have washed their garments and have been cleansed
    8: they shall take an ox from the herd, with its libation of fine wheat flour sprinkled with oil; then you shall receive another ox from the herd for sin
    9: And you shall bring forward the Levites before the tabernacle of the covenant, calling together all the multitude of the sons of Israel
    10: And when the Levites are before the Lord, the sons of Israel shall place their hands upon them
    11: And Aaron shall offer the Levites as a gift in the sight of the Lord, from the sons of Israel, so that they may serve in his ministry
    12: Likewise, the Levites shall place their hands upon the heads of the oxen; you shall make use of one of these for sin, and the other as a holocaust to the Lord, so that you may intercede for them
    13: And you shall set the Levites in the sight of Aaron and his sons, and you shall consecrate those being offered to the Lord
    14: and you shall separate them from the midst of the sons of Israel, so that they may be for me
    15: And after this, they shall enter the tabernacle of the covenant, in order to serve me. And so shall you purify and consecrate them as an oblation to the Lord. For they were given to me as a gift from the sons of Israel
    16: I have accepted them in place of the firstborn which open every womb in Israel
    17: For all the firstborn of the sons of Israel, as much from men as from beasts, are mine. From the day when I struck down all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, I have sanctified them to myself
    18: And I have taken the Levites in place of all the firstborn of the sons of Israel
    19: And I have delivered them as a gift to Aaron and his sons, from the midst of the people, in order to serve me, for Israel, in the tabernacle of the covenant, and in order to pray for them, lest there be a scourge among the people, if they were to dare to approach to my Sanctuary.
    20: And Moses and Aaron, and all the multitude of the sons of Israel, accomplished all that the Lord had commanded Moses concerning the Levites
    21: And they were purified, and they washed their garments. And Aaron lifted them up in the sight of the Lord, and he prayed for them
    22: so that, having been purified, they might enter to their duties in the tabernacle of the covenant before Aaron and his sons. Just as the Lord had instructed Moses about the Levites, so was it done
    23: And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying
    24: “This is the law of the Levites: From twenty-five years and above, they shall enter to minister in the tabernacle of the covenant
    25: And when they will have completed the fiftieth year of age, they shall cease to serve
    26: And they shall be the ministers of their brothers in the tabernacle of the covenant, in order to care for the things that have been commended to them, but not to perform the works themselves. So shall you assign the Levites in their duties.
