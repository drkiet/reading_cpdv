Day 208:

Reading Isaiah, chapters ['13', '14', '15', '16']:

  Chapter 13.

    1: The burden of Babylon which Isaiah, the son of Amoz, saw
    2: Over the foggy mountain lift up a sign! Raise the voice, lift up the hand, and let the rulers enter through the gates
    3: In my wrath, I commanded my sanctified ones, and I called my strong ones, those who exult in my glory
    4: On the mountains, there is the voice of a multitude, as if of a numerous people, a voice with the sound of kings, of nations gathered together. For the Lord of hosts has given orders to soldiers of war
    5: to those who are arriving from a far off land, from the heights of the heavens. It is the Lord and the instruments of his fury, so that he may bring ruin to all the earth
    6: Wail aloud! For the day of the Lord draws near! It will arrive like a devastation from the Lord
    7: Because of it, every hand will fail, and every heart of man will waste away and be crushed
    8: Writhing and pain will seize them. They will be in pain, like a woman in labor. Each one will appear stupefied to his neighbor. Their countenances will be like faces which have been burned up
    9: Behold, the day of the Lord approaches: a cruel day, full of indignation and wrath and fury, which will place the earth in solitude and crush the sinners from it
    10: For the stars of the heavens, in their splendor, will not display their light. The sun will be obscured at its rising, and the moon will not shine in her brightness
    11: And I will act against the evils of the world, and against the impious for their iniquity. And I will cause the pride of the unfaithful to cease, and I will bring down the arrogance of the strong
    12: A man will be more precious than gold, and mankind will become like pure refined gold
    13: For this purpose, I will stir up heaven, and the earth will be moved from its place, because of the indignation of the Lord of hosts, because of the day of his furious wrath
    14: And they will be like a doe fleeing away, or like sheep; and there will be no one who may gather them together. Each one will turn to his own people, and every one will flee to his own land
    15: All who are found will be killed, and all who are caught unaware will fall by the sword
    16: Their infants will be thrown down violently before their eyes. Their houses will be plundered, and their wives will be violated
    17: Behold, I will stir up the Medes against them. They will not seek silver, nor desire gold
    18: Instead, with their arrows, they will put the little children to death, and they will take no pity on breastfeeding women, and their eye will not spare their children
    19: And then Babylon, the glorious one among kingdoms, that famous pride of the Chaldeans, will be destroyed, even as the Lord destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah
    20: It will not be inhabited, even unto the end, and it will not be reestablished, even from generation to generation. The Arab will not pitch his tents there, nor will the shepherds take rest there
    21: Instead, the wild beasts will rest there, and their houses will be filled with serpents, and ostriches will live there, and the hairy ones will leap about there
    22: And the tawny owls will answer one another there, in its buildings, and the Sirens in its shrines of pleasure

  Chapter 14.

    1: Her time is drawing near, and her days will not be prolonged. For the Lord will take pity on Jacob, and he will still choose from Israel, and he will cause them to rest upon their own soil. And the new arrival will be joined to them, and he will adhere to the house of Jacob
    2: And the people will take them, and lead them to their place. And the house of Israel will possess them, in the land of the Lord, as men and women servants. And they will take captive those who had taken them captive. And they will subjugate their oppressors
    3: And this shall be in that day: when God will have given you rest from your labor, and from your oppression, and from the difficult servitude under which you served before
    4: you will accept this parable against the king of Babylon, and you will say: “How is it that the oppressor has ceased, along with his tribute
    5: The Lord has crushed the staff of the impious, the scepter of despots
    6: which struck the people in wrath with an incurable wound, which subjugated the nations in fury, which persecuted with cruelty
    7: All the earth has become quiet and still; it has been gladdened and has rejoiced
    8: The evergreens, too, have rejoiced over you, and the cedars of Lebanon, saying: ‘Since you have slept, no one has ascended who would cut us down.
    9: Hell below was stirred up to meet you at your advent; it has awakened the giants for you. All the leaders of the earth have risen from their thrones, all the leaders among the nations.
    10: Everyone will respond and will say to you: “Now you are wounded, just as we were; you have become like us
    11: Your arrogance has been dragged down to Hell. Your body has fallen dead. The moths will be strewn beneath you, and the worms will be your covering
    12: How is it that you have fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, who used to rise like the sun? How is it that you have fallen to the earth, you who wounded the peoples
    13: And you said in your heart: ‘I will climb up to heaven. I will exalt my throne above the stars of God. I will be enthroned upon the mountain of the covenant, on the northern parts
    14: I will ascend above the tops of the clouds. I will be like the Most High.
    15: Yet truly, you shall be dragged down to Hell, into the depths of the pit
    16: Those who see you, will lean toward you, and will gaze upon you, saying: ‘Could this be the man who disturbed the earth, who shook kingdoms
    17: who made the world into a desert and destroyed its cities, who would not even open a prison for his prisoners?’ 
    18: All the kings of the nations throughout the whole world have slept in glory, each man in his own house
    19: But you have been rejected from your grave, like a useless polluted plant, and you have been bound up with those who were slain by the sword, and who descended to the bottom of the pit, like a rotting carcass
    20: You will not be associated with them, even in the grave. For you have destroyed your own land; you have slain your own people. The offspring of the wicked ones will not be called upon for eternity
    21: Prepare his sons for the slaughter, according to the iniquity of their fathers. They will not rise up, nor inherit the earth, nor fill the face of the world with cities
    22: But I will rise up against them, says the Lord of hosts. And I will perish the name of Babylon and its remnants: both the plant and its progeny, says the Lord
    23: And I will appoint it as a possession for the hedgehog, with swamps of water. And I will sweep it out and wear it away with a brush, says the Lord of hosts
    24: The Lord of hosts has sworn, saying: Surely, just as I have considered it, so shall it be, and in the same manner as I have drawn it through my mind
    25: so shall it occur. So shall I crush the Assyrian in my land, and I will trample him upon my mountains, and his yoke will be taken away from them, and his burden will be removed from their shoulder
    26: This is the plan that I have decided, concerning the entire earth, and this is the hand which is extended over all the nations
    27: For the Lord of hosts has decreed it, and who is able to weaken it? And his hand is extended, so who can avert it
    28: In the year in which king Ahaz died, this burden was given
    29: You should not rejoice, all you of Philistia, that the rod of him who struck you has been crushed. For from the root of the serpent will go forth a king snake, and his offspring will engulf that which flies
    30: And the firstborn of the poor will be pastured, and the poor will rest in faithfulness. And I will cause your root to pass away by famine, and I will put to death your remnant
    31: Wail, O gate! Cry out, O city! All of Philistia has been prostrated. For a smoke will arrive from the north, and there is no one who will escape his army
    32: And what will be the response to this news among the nations? It will be that the Lord has established Zion, and that the poor of his people will hope in him

  Chapter 15.

    1: The burden of Moab. Because Ar of Moab has been destroyed by night, it is utterly silent. Because the wall of Moab has been destroyed by night, it is utterly silent
    2: The house has ascended with Dibon to the heights, in mourning over Nebo and over Medeba. Moab has wailed. There will be baldness on all of their heads, and every beard will be shaven
    3: At their crossroads, they have been wrapped with sackcloth. On their rooftops and in their streets, everyone descends, wailing and weeping
    4: Heshbon will cry out with Elealeh. Their voice has been heard as far as Jahaz. Over this, the well-equipped men of Moab wail; each soul will wail to itself
    5: My heart will cry out to Moab; its bars will cry out even to Zoar, like a three-year-old calf. For they will ascend weeping, by way of the ascent of Luhith. And along the way of Horonaim, they will lift up a cry of contrition
    6: For the waters of Nimrim will be desolate, because the plants have withered, and the seedling has failed, and all the greenery has passed away
    7: This is in accord with the magnitude of their works and of their visitation. They will lead them to the torrent of the willows
    8: For an outcry has circulated along the border of Moab; its wailing even to Eglaim, and its clamor even to the well of Elim
    9: Because the waters of Dibon have been filled with blood, I will place even more upon Dibon: those from Moab who flee the lion, and the survivors of the earth

  Chapter 16.

    1: O Lord, send forth the Lamb, the Ruler of the earth, from the Rock of the desert to the mountain of the daughter of Zion
    2: And this shall be: like a bird fleeing away, and like fledglings flying from the nest, so will the daughters of Moab be at the passage of Arnon
    3: Form a plan. Call a council. Let your shadow be as if it were night, even at midday. Conceal the fugitives, and do not betray the wanderers
    4: My fugitives will live with you. Become a hiding place, O Moab, from the face of the destroyer. For the dust is at its end; the miserable one has been consumed. He who trampled the earth has failed
    5: And a throne will be prepared in mercy, and One shall sit upon it in truth, in the tabernacle of David, judging and seeking judgment, and quickly repaying what is just
    6: We have heard of the pride of Moab; he is very proud. His pride and his arrogance and his indignation is more than his strength
    7: For this reason, Moab will wail to Moab; each one will wail. Speak of their wounds to those who rejoice upon the brick walls
    8: For the suburbs of Heshbon are deserted, and the lords of the Gentiles have cut down the vineyard of Sibmah. Its vines have arrived even at Jazer. They have wandered in the desert. Its seedlings have been abandoned. They have crossed over the sea
    9: I will weep with the tears of Jazer over this, the vineyard of Sibmah. I will inebriate you with my tears, Heshbon and Elealeh! For the sound of those who trample has rushed over your vintage and over your harvest
    10: And so, rejoicing and exultation will be taken away from Carmel, and there will be no jubilation or exultation in the vineyards. He who was accustomed to tread will not tread out the wine in the winepress. I have taken away the sound of those who tread
    11: Over this, my heart will resonate like a harp for Moab, and my inner most being for the brick wall
    12: And this shall be: when it is seen that Moab has struggled upon his high places, he will enter his holy places to pray, but he will not prevail
    13: This is the word that the Lord has spoken to Moab concerning that time
    14: And now the Lord has spoken, saying: In three years, like the years of a hired hand, the glory of Moab concerning the entire multitude of the people will be taken away, and what is left behind will be small and weak and not so numerous
