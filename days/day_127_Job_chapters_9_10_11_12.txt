Day 127:

Reading Job, chapters ['9', '10', '11', '12']:

  Chapter 9.

    1: And Job, responding, said
    2: Truly, I know that it is so, and that man cannot be justified compared with God
    3: If he chooses to contend with him, he is not able to respond to him once out of a thousand times
    4: He is understanding in heart and mighty in strength; who has resisted him and yet had peace
    5: He has moved mountains, and those whom he overthrew in his fury did not know it
    6: He shakes the earth out of its place and its pillars tremble
    7: He commands the sun and it does not rise, and he closes the stars as if under a seal
    8: He alone extends the heavens, and he walks upon the waves of the sea
    9: He fashions Arcturus, and Orion, and Hyades, and the interior of the south
    10: He accomplishes great and incomprehensible and miraculous things, which cannot be numbered
    11: If he approaches me, I will not see him; if he departs, I will not understand
    12: If he suddenly should question, who will answer him? Or who can say, “Why did you do so?
    13: God, whose wrath no one is able to resist, and under whom they bend who carry the world
    14: what am I then, that I should answer him and exchange words with him
    15: And if I now have any justice, I will not respond, but will beseech my judge
    16: And if he should listen to me when I call, I would not believe that he had heard my voice
    17: For he will crush me in a whirlwind and multiply my wounds, even without cause
    18: He does not permit my spirit to rest, and he fills me with bitterness
    19: If strength is sought, he is most strong; if equity in judgment, no one would dare to give testimony for me
    20: If I wanted to justify myself, my own mouth will condemn me; if I would reveal my innocence, he would prove me depraved
    21: And if I now became simple, my soul would be ignorant even of this, and my life would weary me
    22: There is one thing that I have said: both the innocent and the impious he consumes
    23: If he scourges, let him kill all at once, and not laugh at the punishment of the innocent
    24: Since the earth has been given into the hand of the impious, he covers the face of its judges; for if it is not him, then who is it
    25: My days have been swifter than a messenger; they have fled and have not seen goodness
    26: They have passed by like ships carrying fruits, just like an eagle flying to food
    27: If I say: “By no means will I speak this way.” I change my face and I am tortured with sorrow
    28: I have dreaded all my works, knowing that you did not spare the offender
    29: Yet, if I am also just as impious, why have I labored in vain
    30: If I had been washed with snow-like waters, and my hands were shining like the cleanest thing
    31: yet you would plunge me in filth, and my own garments would abhor me
    32: For even I would not answer a man who were like myself, nor one who could be heard with me equally in judgment
    33: There is no one who could both prevail in argument and in placing his hand between the two
    34: Let him take his staff away from me, and let not the fear of him terrify me
    35: I will speak and I will not fear him, for in fearfulness I am not able to respond

  Chapter 10.

    1: My soul is weary of my life. I will release my words against myself. I will speak in the bitterness of my soul
    2: I will say to God: Do not be willing to condemn me. Reveal to me why you judge me this way
    3: Does it seem good to you, if you find fault with me and oppress me, the work of your own hands, and assist the counsel of the impious
    4: Do you have bodily eyes? Or, just as man sees, will you see
    5: Are your days just like the days of man, and are your years as the times of humans
    6: so that you would inquire about my iniquity and examine my sin
    7: And you know that I have done nothing impious, yet there is no one who can deliver from your hand
    8: Your hands have made me and formed me all around, and, in this way, do you suddenly throw me away
    9: Remember, I ask you, that you have fashioned me like clay, and you will reduce me to dust
    10: Have you not extracted me like milk and curdled me like cheese
    11: You have clothed me with skin and flesh. You have put me together with bones and nerves
    12: You have assigned to me life and mercy, and your visitation has preserved my spirit
    13: Though you may conceal this in your heart, yet I know that you remember everything
    14: If I have sinned, and you have spared me for an hour, why do you not endure me to be clean from my iniquity
    15: And if I should be impious, woe to me, and if I should be just, I will not lift up my head, being drenched with affliction and misery
    16: And because of pride, you will seize me like a lioness, and having returned, you torment me to an extraordinary degree
    17: You renew your testimony against me, and you multiply your wrath against me, and these punishments make war within me
    18: Why did you lead me out of the womb? If only I had been consumed, so that no eye would ever see me
    19: I should have been as if I had not been: transferred from the womb to the tomb
    20: Will not my few days be completed soon? Release me, therefore, so that I may lament my sorrows a little
    21: before I depart and return no more to a land that is dark and covered with the fog of death
    22: a land of misery and darkness, where the shadow of death, and nothing else but everlasting horror, dwells

  Chapter 11.

    1: But Zophar the Naamathite, responding, said
    2: Will he who speaks much, not also listen? Or will a talkative man be justified
    3: Will men be silent only for you? And when you have mocked others, will no one refute you
    4: For you said: “My word is pure, and I am clean in your sight.
    5: Yet I wish that God would speak with you, and would open his lips to you
    6: so that he might reveal to you the secrets of wisdom, and how intricate his law is, and that you would understand how much less he requires of you than your iniquity deserves
    7: By chance, will you comprehend the footsteps of God and reach all the way to the perfection of the Almighty
    8: He is higher than heaven, and what will you do? He is deeper than hell, but how will you know
    9: His measure is longer than the earth and wider than the sea
    10: If he overturns all things, or packs them together, who will contradict him
    11: For he knows the vanity of men, and when he sees iniquity, does he not evaluate it
    12: A vain man is lifted up in arrogance, and he thinks that he is born free like a wild ass’s colt
    13: But you have fortified your heart and extended your hands to him
    14: If you would send away from you the iniquity that is in your hand, and not let injustice remain in your tabernacle
    15: then you would be able to lift up your face without blemish, and you would be steadfast and unafraid
    16: Misery, likewise, you would forget, or would remember only like waters that have passed by
    17: And brightness, like that of midday, will rise upon you until evening, and when you would think yourself consumed, you will rise up like the morning star
    18: And, when hope has been set before you, you will have faith, and, when buried, you will sleep secure
    19: You will rest, and there will be nothing to make you afraid, and many will make requests before your face
    20: But the eyes of the impious will fade away, and the path to escape will perish before them, for the abomination of the soul is their hope

  Chapter 12.

    1: Then Job, answering, said
    2: Are you, therefore, alone among men, and will wisdom die with you
    3: And I have a heart just as you also do, and I am not inferior to you. For who is ignorant of these things, which you know
    4: He who is mocked by his friends as I am, will call upon God, and he will listen to him because it is the sincerity of the just that is being mocked
    5: The lamp that is despised in the thoughts of the rich is ready for the appointed time
    6: The tabernacles of robbers are numerous, and they provoke God boldly; whereas, it is he who has given all things into their hands
    7: In truth, ask the mules, and they will teach you, and the birds of the sky, and they will reveal to you
    8: Speak with the earth, and it will respond to you, and the fish of the sea will explain
    9: Who is ignorant that the hand of the Lord has made all these things
    10: In his hand is the soul of all the living and the spirit of all the flesh of mankind
    11: Does not the ear perceive words, and the palate, when eating, perceive flavor
    12: In old age is wisdom, and in length of days is prudence
    13: With him is wisdom and strength, he has counsel and understanding
    14: If he tears down, there is no one who can build up; if he encloses a man, there is no one who can open
    15: If he restrains the waters, everything will dry up; and if he sends them forth, they will subdue the land
    16: With him is strength and wisdom; he knows both the deceiver and he who is deceived
    17: He leads advisors to a foolish end and judges to stupidity
    18: He removes the belt of kings and encircles their waist with a rope
    19: He leads away priests in dishonor and displaces nobles
    20: altering the lips of those who speak the truth and sweeping away the teaching of the aged
    21: He pours disdain upon the leaders, relieving those who had been oppressed
    22: He reveals the depths of the darkness, and he brings the shadow of death into the light
    23: He multiplies peoples, and destroys them, and, having been overthrown, he restores them anew
    24: He transforms the heart of the leaders of the people on earth, and misleads those who in vain advance upon the inviolable
    25: They will grope as in the darkness, not the light, and he will make them stagger like drunkards
