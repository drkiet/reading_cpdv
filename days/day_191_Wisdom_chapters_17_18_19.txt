Day 191:

Reading Wisdom, chapters ['17', '18', '19']:

  Chapter 17.

    1: For your judgments, O Lord, are great, and your words are indescribable. Therefore, undisciplined souls have wandered astray
    2: For, while they managed to convince the unjust, so as to obtain dominion over the holy nation, they themselves were fettered with chains of darkness and of endless night, enclosed in their houses, fugitives of everlasting providence, lying in ruins
    3: And, while they thought to escape notice in their secret sins, they were scattered under a dark veil of oblivion, being horribly afraid, and having been disturbed with great astonishment
    4: For neither did the cave which enclosed them preserve them from fear, because descending noises disturbed them, and the sorrowful persons appearing to them intensified their fear
    5: And, indeed, even fire had no strength to provide them light, nor could the clear flames of the stars illuminate that horrible night
    6: Yet there appeared to them a sudden fire, filled with fear; and, having been struck with the fear of that face which is unseen, they considered those things which they did see to be worse
    7: and, having been ridiculed, the illusions were removed from their arts along with their contemptuous rebuke of glorious wisdom
    8: Indeed, those who promised to drive away fears and disturbances from a languishing soul, though they were filled with derision, were themselves languishing in fear
    9: And, even if nothing unnatural disturbed them, yet being agitated by the passing of animals and the hissing of snakes, they died of fear, denying what they themselves saw even in the air, which no one thinks to be able to escape
    10: For, while there may be apprehension with wickedness, it gives testimony to condemnation, for a troubled conscience always forecasts harshness
    11: For fear is nothing else but unfaithfulness to thinking helpful things
    12: And, while expectation is driven from within, the cause of this is supposing that one is great in knowledge, and as a result, conflict excels
    13: Yet those who were truly powerless that night, being overcome by both the vilest and the deepest hell, were sleeping the same sleep
    14: sometimes stirred up by the fear of unnatural things, other times sinking down in disgrace of soul, for a sudden and unexpected fear overcame them
    15: Then, if any among them had fallen away, he was kept in a prison without bars which had been left open
    16: For if a farmer, or a shepherd, or a worker in a field of labor were suddenly overcome, he endured an inescapable necessity
    17: For they were all bound together with one chain of darkness. Or if there were a whistling wind, or the sweet sound of birds among the thick tree branches, or the force of water rushing excessively
    18: or the strong noise of rocks crashing down, or the scattering of playful animals having been seen, or the strong voice of bellowing beasts, or the resounding of the highest mountain echo, these things made them sink down because of fear
    19: For the whole world was enlightened with a clear light, and none were being hindered in their labors
    20: But then, the heavy night was placed over the sun for them, an image of that darkness which was about to overcome them. Yet they were more grievous to themselves than was the darkness

  Chapter 18.

    1: But your saints were your greatest light, and they heard your voice, but did not see your form. And because they themselves did not also suffer the same things, they praised you greatly
    2: And those who were wounded before, gave thanks, because they were no longer being wounded, and because they had petitioned for this gift, that there would be this difference
    3: Because of this, they had a burning column of fire as a guide on the unknown way, and you displayed a harmless sun of a good hospitality
    4: The others, indeed, deserved to be deprived of the light and to endure a prison of darkness, who watched for an opportunity to imprison your sons, by whom the incorruptible light of the law was beginning to be given to future generations
    5: When they thought to kill the babes of the just, one son having been exposed and set free, to their disgrace, you took away a multitude of their sons and destroyed them all together in a mighty water
    6: For that night was known beforehand by our fathers, so that, knowing the truth of the oaths in which they had trusted, they might be more peaceful in their souls
    7: Yet your people received not only the salvation of the just, but also the destruction of the unjust
    8: For just as you wounded our adversaries, so also did you greatly esteem calling us forth
    9: For the just children of goodness were secretly offering sacrifice, and in agreement they administered the law of justice, so that both good and bad would be able to receive justice, and so that you might now approve of their chanting to the father
    10: On the other hand, a dissimilar voice was resounding from the enemies, and a lamentable wailing was heard for the children who were being cried over
    11: But the same punishment afflicted the servant with the master, and the common man endured the same as the king
    12: Therefore, all were the same, with one name for death, and the dead were innumerable. For neither were the living sufficient to bury the dead, because, with a single effort, their most illustrious nation was exterminated
    13: For they would not believe anything because of the drugs; then truly, at the beginning, when the extermination of the firstborn happened, they pledged the people to belong to God
    14: For, when a quiet silence surrounded all things, and when the course of the night was passing the middle of its journey
    15: your almighty word from heaven leapt down from your royal throne, as a fierce warrior in the midst of the land of extermination
    16: as a sharp sword carrying your unfeigned authority, and standing, filled all things with death, and, standing on the earth, reached all the way up to touch heaven
    17: Then, incessant visions of nightmares disturbed them, and unexpected fears overcame them
    18: And another was thrown down elsewhere half-alive; and so, by means of that which was dying, the cause of death was revealed
    19: For the visions that disturbed them had forewarned of these things, lest they should perish and not know why they suffered these evils
    20: Yet, at that time, the trial of death touched even the just, and there was a disturbance of the multitude in the wilderness, but your wrath did not continue for long
    21: For a blameless man, prospering, is to be entreated for your people, bringing forth the shield of your service, through prayer and incense, making prayerful supplication, he withstands anger, and so establishes an end to the necessary difficulty, revealing that he is your servant
    22: Yet he outlasted the disturbance, not by virtue of the body, nor by force of arms, but, with a word, he subdued those who were troubling him, commemorating the oaths and covenant of the parents
    23: For when they were now fallen down dead by heaps one upon another, he stood between them and cut off their attack, and he divided those who controlled the path to the living
    24: For, within the garment of shame which he held, the world was all together, and the great deeds of the parents were engraved on four orders of stones, and your majesty was engraved on the crown of his head
    25: Yet he who was exterminating yielded even to those he frightened. For one trial of wrath was sufficient

  Chapter 19.

    1: But the impious, all the way to the very end, were overcome by anger without mercy. Indeed, he knew beforehand even their future
    2: Yet, seeing that they might have repented, so that they would be led by him and be sent forth with great concern, the just sought the impious, while regretting their deeds
    3: For, while the just were still holding grief in their hands and weeping at the tombs of the dead, these others took upon themselves another senseless thought, and they cast out the legislators and pursued them as if they were fugitives
    4: For a fitting necessity was leading them to this end, and they were losing the remembrance of those things which had happened, so that what was lacking in the sufferings of the conflict might be completed by the punishment
    5: and so that your people, indeed, might wonderfully pass through, but these others might find a new death
    6: For every creature according to its kind was fashioned again as from the beginning, diligently serving your teachings, so that your children would be preserved unharmed
    7: For a cloud overshadowed their camp, and where water was before, dry land appeared, and in the Red Sea, a way without hindrance, and out of the great deep, a level field sprung up
    8: through which the whole nation passed, protected by your hand, seeing your miracles and wonders
    9: For they consumed food like horses, and they leapt about like lambs, praising you, O Lord, who had freed them
    10: For they were still mindful of those things which had happened during the time of their sojourn, how, instead of cattle, the earth brought forth flies, and instead of fish, the river cast up a multitude of frogs
    11: And, lastly, they saw a new kind of bird, when, being led by their desire, they demanded a feast of meat
    12: For, to console their loss, the quail came up to them from the sea, and yet troubles overcame the sinners, though they were not without the evidence of what had happened before by the power of lightning, for they suffered justly according to their own wickedness
    13: And indeed, they set up a more detestable inhospitality. Certainly, some have refused to receive unknown foreigners, but these others were drafting good guests into servitude
    14: and not only foreigners, but also those who had been under their care, because they were reluctantly sheltering the outsiders
    15: Yet whoever had sheltered them with gladness, by making use of the very same justice, they afflicted with the most severe sorrow
    16: Yet they were struck with blindness, like someone brought before the gates of justice, so that they were suddenly covered with darkness, and each one was left searching for the threshold of his front door
    17: For the elements in themselves are in the process of being changed, just as when the sound of a musical instrument is being altered in quality, yet each one keeps its own sound, from where it is considered to be and according to its fixed appearance
    18: For the countryside was transformed by water, and things which were swimming, crossed over the land
    19: Fire prevailed in the midst of water, beyond its own power, and the water forgot its quenching nature
    20: On the other hand, the flames did not trouble the bodies of the mortal animals walking around, nor did they melt that good food, which is as easily melted as ice. For in all things, O Lord, you magnified your people, and honored them, and did not despise them, but at every time and in every place, you assisted them
