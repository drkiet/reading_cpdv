Day 129:

Reading Job, chapters ['17', '18', '19', '20']:

  Chapter 17.

    1: My spirit will be wasted, my days will be shortened, and only the grave will be left for me
    2: I have not sinned, yet my eye remains in bitterness
    3: Free me, O Lord, and set me beside you, and let the hand of anyone you wish fight against me
    4: You have set their heart far from discipline; therefore, they will not be praised
    5: He promises prey to his companions, but the eyes of his sons will grow faint
    6: He has posted me like a proverb to the people, and I am an example in their presence
    7: My eyesight has been clouded by indignation, and my limbs have been reduced, as if to nothing
    8: The just will be astounded over this, and the innocent will be stirred up against the hypocrite
    9: And the just will cling to his way, and clean hands will increase strength
    10: Therefore, be converted, all of you, and approach, for I do not find in you any wisdom
    11: My days have passed away; my thoughts have been scattered, tormenting my heart
    12: They have turned night into day, and I hope for light again after the darkness
    13: If I should wait, the underworld is my house, and in darkness I have spread out my bed
    14: I have said to decay and to worms: “You are my father, my mother, and my sister.
    15: Therefore, where is my expectation now, and who is it that considers my patience
    16: Everything of mine will descend into the deepest underworld; do you think that, in that place at least, there will be rest for me

  Chapter 18.

    1: But Baldad the Suhite responded by saying
    2: How long will you throw around words? Understand first, and then let us speak
    3: Why have we been treated like mules, as if we were unworthy before you
    4: You, who ruins your own soul in your fury, will the earth be forsaken because of you, and will the cliffs be moved from their place
    5: Will not the light of the impious be put out, and the flame of his fire refuse to shine
    6: Light will become darkness in his tabernacle, and the lamp that is over him will be extinguished
    7: His strong steps will be constrained, and his own counsel will cast him down uncontrollably
    8: For he has caused his own feet to go into a net, and he has walked into its web
    9: His heel will be held in a snare, and thirst will rage against him
    10: A trap has been hidden for him in the earth, and a decoy, along his path
    11: Horrifying things will terrify him everywhere and will entangle his feet
    12: Let his strength be diminished by famine, and let starvation invade his ribs
    13: Let it devour the beauty of his skin; let the ancient death consume his arms
    14: Let his confidence be torn away from his tabernacle, and let ruin trample over him like a king
    15: Let the companions of he who is not, dwell in his tabernacle; let brimstone rain down upon his tabernacle
    16: Let his roots be dried up from beneath him, and his harvest be crushed from above
    17: Let the memory of him perish from the earth, and let not his name be celebrated in the streets
    18: He will expel him from light into darkness, and he will remove him from the world
    19: Neither his offspring, nor his descendents, will exist among his people, nor will there be any remnants in his country
    20: The last will be astonished at his day, and the first will be overcome with horror
    21: And so, these are the tabernacles of the sinful, and this the place of he who does not know God

  Chapter 19.

    1: But Job answered by saying
    2: How long will you afflict my soul and wear me down with words
    3: So, ten times you confound me and are not ashamed to oppress me
    4: Now, of course, if I have been ignorant, my ignorance will be with me
    5: But you have risen up against me, and you accuse me to my disgrace
    6: At least now you should understand that God has not afflicted me with a balanced judgment, though he has encompassed me with his scourges
    7: Behold, I will cry out, enduring violence, and no one will hear. I will announce loudly, but there is no one who may judge
    8: He has hemmed in my path, and I cannot pass; he has added darkness to my difficult path
    9: He has plundered me of my glory, and he has stolen the crown from my head
    10: He has destroyed me on every side, and I am lost, and, like an uprooted tree, he has taken away my hope
    11: His fury has raged against me, and in this way he has treated me like his enemy
    12: His troops have gathered together, and they have made their way to me, and they have besieged my tabernacle all around
    13: He has put my brothers far from me, and my friends have withdrawn from me like strangers
    14: My kinsmen have forsaken me, and those who knew me, have forgotten me
    15: The inhabitants of my house and my maidservants treat me just as if I were a stranger, and I have been like a sojourner in their eyes
    16: I called my servant, and he did not respond; I pleaded with him with my own mouth
    17: My wife has shuddered at my breath, and I have begged the sons of my loins
    18: Even the foolish have looked down on me, and, when I withdrew from them, they spoke ill of me
    19: Those who were sometimes my counselors, treat me like an abomination; and he whom I valued the most has turned against me
    20: Since my flesh has been consumed, my bone adheres to my skin, and only my lips have been left around my teeth
    21: Have mercy on me, have compassion on me, at least you my friends, because the hand of the Lord has touched me
    22: Why do you pursue me just as God does, and satiate yourselves with my flesh
    23: Who will grant to me that my words may be written down? Who will grant to me that they may be inscribed in a book
    24: with an iron pen and a plate of lead, or else be carved in stone
    25: For I know that my Redeemer lives, and on the last day I will rise out of the earth
    26: And I will be enveloped again with my skin, and in my flesh I will see my God
    27: It is he whom I myself will see, and he whom my eyes will behold, and no other. This, my hope, has taken rest in my bosom
    28: Why then do you now say: “Let us pursue him, and let us find a basis to speak against him?
    29: So then, flee from the face of the sword, for the sword is the avenger of iniquities; but know this: there is to be a judgment

  Chapter 20.

    1: Then Zophar the Naamathite answered by saying
    2: In response, various thoughts succeed one another in me, and my mind moves quickly through different ideas
    3: The teaching you use to admonish me, I will hear, and the spirit of my understanding will respond for me
    4: This, I know, is from the beginning, from the time that man was set over the earth
    5: that the praise of the impious shall be short, and the joy of the hypocrite lasts only a moment
    6: If his pride ascends even towards the heavens, and his head touches the clouds
    7: in the end, he will be destroyed like a trash heap, and those who had seen him will say: “Where is he?
    8: Like a dream that flies away, he will not be found; he will pass away like a nightmare
    9: The eyes that had seen him, will not see him; no longer will his own place admire him
    10: His sons will be worn away by poverty, and his own hands will deliver his grief to him
    11: His bones will be filled with the vices of his youth, and they will sleep with him in the dust
    12: For, when evil will be sweet in his mouth, he will hide it under his tongue
    13: He will permit it, and not abandon it, and he will conceal it in his throat
    14: His bread in his belly will be turned into the venom of snakes within him
    15: The riches that he devours, he will vomit up, and from his stomach God will draw them out
    16: He will suck the head of snakes, and the tongue of the viper will kill him
    17: (May he never see the streams of the river, the torrents of honey and butter.
    18: He will be repaid for all he has done, yet he will not be consumed; according to the multitude of his schemes, so also will he suffer
    19: For, having broken in, he stripped the poor. He has quickly stolen away a house he did not build
    20: And yet his stomach will not be satisfied, and when he has the things he desires, he will not be able to possess them
    21: Nothing remained of his portion, and, because of this, nothing will continue of his kind
    22: When he will be satisfied, he will be constrained; he will seethe, and all anguish will fall upon him
    23: May his stomach be filled, so that God may send forth the fury of his wrath to him and may rain down his battle upon him
    24: He will flee from weapons of iron, and he will fall in an arc of brass
    25: which had been drawn and had issued forth from its sheath, glittering in its bitterness: the horrible ones will go forth and approach over him
    26: All darkness has been hidden in his secrecy. A fire that has not been set will devour him; he will be thrown down and forsaken in his tabernacle
    27: The heavens will reveal his sinfulness, and the earth will rise up against him
    28: The offspring of his house will be exposed; he will be pulled down in the day of God’s wrath
    29: This is the portion of a wicked man from God, and the inheritance of his words from the Lord
