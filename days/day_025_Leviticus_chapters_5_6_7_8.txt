Day 25:

Reading Leviticus, chapters ['5', '6', '7', '8']:

  Chapter 5.

    1: If a soul will have sinned, and heard the voice of one testifying under oath, and he is a witness because either he has seen it himself, or he is aware of it: if he does not reveal it, he shall carry his iniquity
    2: The soul that will have touched anything unclean, either that which has been killed by a beast, or that which has died on its own, or any other creeping thing, and will have forgotten its uncleanness, he is guilty and has committed a transgression
    3: And if he will have touched anything from the uncleanness of man, according to every kind of impurity by which he may be defiled, and having forgotten it, afterwards realizes it, he shall be guilty of committing a transgression
    4: The soul who swears and offers from his own lips that he would do either evil or good, and who will have bound the same with an oath and with his own words, and, having forgotten it, afterwards understands his transgression
    5: let him do penance for his sin
    6: and let him offer from the flocks a female lamb or a she-goat, and the priest shall pray for him and for his sin
    7: But if he is not able to offer a beast, let him offer two turtledoves or two young pigeons to the Lord, one for sin, and the other for a holocaust
    8: And he shall give them to the priest, who, offering the first for sin, shall twist back its head to the little wings, so that it adheres to the neck and is not entirely broken off
    9: And he shall sprinkle some of its blood at the side of the altar. But whatever will remain, he shall cause it to drip down to the base, because it is for sin
    10: Yet truly, the other he shall burn as a holocaust, just as is usually done. And the priest shall pray for him, and for his sin, and he shall be released from it
    11: But if his hand is unable to offer two turtledoves or two young pigeons, he shall offer, for his sin, the tenth part of an ephah of fine wheat flour. He shall not put oil in it, nor place upon it any frankincense, because it is for sin
    12: And he shall deliver it to the priest, who shall take a handful of it, and shall burn it upon the altar as a memorial for him who offered it
    13: praying for him and making atonement. Yet truly, the remaining part he himself shall have as a gift
    14: And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying
    15: If a soul, by mistake, shall have transgressed the ceremonies in those things that are sanctified to the Lord, he shall offer for his offense an immaculate ram from the flocks, such as can be bought for two shekels, according to the weight of the Sanctuary
    16: And he shall make restitution for the damage that he has brought, and he shall add a fifth part more, delivering it to the priest, who shall pray for him while offering the ram, and he shall be released from it
    17: If a soul will have sinned through ignorance, and will have done one of those things which the law of the Lord prohibits, and, being guilty of sin, understands his iniquity
    18: he shall offer from the flocks an immaculate ram to the priest, according to the measure and estimation of the sin, who shall pray for him, because he did it unknowingly, and he shall be released from it
    19: because by mistake he transgressed against the Lord

  Chapter 6.

    1: The Lord spoke to Moses, saying
    2: The soul who will have sinned, and, despising the Lord, will have denied to his neighbor the deposit which he had entrusted to his safekeeping, or who will have extorted anything by force, or who will have made a false accusation
    3: or who will have found a lost thing and then also withheld it by swearing falsely, or who will have done any other of the many things by which men usually sin
    4: being convicted of the offense, he shall restor
    5: all that he wanted to obtain by fraud, the whole plus an additional fifth part, to the owner against whom he brought the damage
    6: Then, on behalf of his sin, he shall offer an immaculate ram from the flock, and he shall give it to the priest, according to the estimation and measure of the offense
    7: And he shall pray for him in the sight of the Lord, and he shall be released from any one of those things that he did when he sinned
    8: And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying
    9: Instruct Aaron and his sons: This is the law of a holocaust. It shall be burned upon the altar, all night until morning. The fire shall be from the same altar
    10: The priest shall be vested with the tunic and the linen undergarments. And he shall take up the ashes of that which the devouring fire has consumed, and, placing them next to the altar
    11: he shall strip off his former vestments, and being clothed with others, he shall carry them beyond the camp, and he shall cause them to be consumed, even to glowing embers, in a very clean place
    12: But the fire on the altar shall burn always, for the priest shall nourish it by placing wood under it each day in the morning. And, laying down the holocaust, he shall burn the fat of the peace offerings upon it
    13: This is the perpetual fire which shall never fail upon the altar
    14: This is the law of the sacrifice and the libations, which the sons of Aaron shall offer in the sight of the Lord, and before the altar
    15: The priest shall take a handful of fine wheat flour, which has been sprinkled with oil, and all the frankincense, which has been placed upon the flour, and he shall burn it upon the altar as a memorial of most sweet odor to the Lord
    16: And the remaining portion of the flour, Aaron shall eat with his sons, without leaven. And he shall eat it in the holy place, in the atrium of the tabernacle
    17: Yet for this reason, it shall not be leavened, because part of it is offered as an incense of the Lord. The Holy of holies shall it be, just as what is offered on behalf of sin and of transgression
    18: Only the males of the stock of Aaron shall eat it. This shall be an everlasting ordinance in your generations concerning the sacrifices of the Lord. All who will touch these shall be sanctified
    19: And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying
    20: This is the oblation of Aaron and of his sons, which they must offer to the Lord in the day of their anointing. They shall offer a tenth part of an ephah of fine wheat flour as a perpetual sacrifice, half of it in the morning, and half of it in the evening
    21: It shall be sprinkled with oil and fried in a frying pan. Then it shall be offered hot, as a most sweet odor to the Lord
    22: by the priest who by law succeeds his father. And it shall be entirely burned on the altar
    23: For every sacrifice of the priest shall be consumed by fire; neither shall anyone eat from it
    24: Then the Lord spoke to Moses, saying
    25: Say to Aaron and his sons: This is the law of the victim for sin. In the place where the holocaust is offered, it shall be immolated in the sight of the Lord. It is the Holy of holies
    26: The priest who offers it shall eat it in the holy place, in the atrium of the tabernacle
    27: Whatever will touch its flesh shall be sanctified. If a garment will be sprinkled with its blood, it shall be washed in a holy place
    28: Then the earthen vessel, in which it was soaked, shall be broken. But if the vessel will be of brass, it shall be scoured and washed with water
    29: Every male of priestly descent shall feed on its flesh, because it is the Holy of holies
    30: For the victim that is slain for sin, whose blood is carried into the tabernacle of the testimony, for expiation in the Sanctuary, shall not be eaten, but it shall be consumed by fire

  Chapter 7.

    1: Likewise, this is the law of the sacrifice for a transgression. It is the Holy of holies
    2: Therefore, where the holocaust is immolated, the victim for a transgression shall also be slain. Its blood shall be poured out all around the altar
    3: They shall offer from it: the rump, and the fat that covers the vital organs
    4: the two little kidneys, and the fat that is near the sides, and the mesh of the liver with the little kidneys
    5: And the priest shall burn them upon the altar. It is the incense of the Lord on behalf of a transgression
    6: Every male of priestly descent shall feed on this flesh in a holy place, because it is the Holy of holies
    7: Just as the sacrifice for sin is offered, so also for a transgression; one law shall be for both sacrifices. It shall belong to the priest who offers it
    8: The priest who offers the victim of holocaust shall have its skin
    9: And every sacrifice of fine wheat flour which is baked in the oven, and whatever is prepared on the oven grating or in the frying pan, shall be for the priest who offers it
    10: Whether these will be sprinkled with oil, or left dry, an equal measure shall be divided to each one of the sons of Aaron
    11: This is the law of the victim of peace offerings, which is offered to the Lord
    12: If the oblation will be an act for giving thanks, they shall offer bread without leaven sprinkled with oil, and unleavened wafers anointed with oil, and fine wheat flour fried, and cakes sprinkled and mixed with oil
    13: and also, leavened bread with the sacrifice of thanksgiving, which is immolated for peace offerings
    14: Of these, one shall be offered to the Lord as the first-fruits, and one shall be for the priest who will pour out the blood of the victim
    15: The flesh of it shall be eaten on the same day; neither shall any of it remain until morning
    16: If anyone, by a vow or of his own accord, will have offered a sacrifice, it shall be eaten in a similar manner on the same day. But then if any of it will have remained until tomorrow, it is lawful to eat it
    17: Then whatever will be found on the third day shall be consumed with fire
    18: If anyone will have eaten from the flesh of the victim of peace offerings on the third day, the oblation will be nullified; neither will it benefit the one who offered it. But instead, whatever soul will contaminate itself with such foods will be guilty of a betrayal
    19: The flesh that has touched anything unclean shall not be eaten, but it shall be burnt with fire. He that is clean will feed on it
    20: If a soul which is polluted will have eaten from the flesh of the sacrifice of peace offerings, which is offered to the Lord, he shall perish from his people
    21: And whoever will have touched the uncleanness of man, or of beast, or of anything which is able to defile, and who will have eaten from this kind of flesh, shall be cut off from his people
    22: And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying
    23: Say to the sons of Israel: The fat of a sheep, and of an ox, and of a goat you shall not eat
    24: The fat of a carcass that has died on its own, or of an animal that has been seized by a wild beast, you shall have for various uses
    25: If anyone will have eaten the fat which ought to be offered as a burnt sacrifice of the Lord, he shall perish from his people
    26: Likewise, you shall not take as food the blood of any animals at all, whether of birds or beasts
    27: Every soul that will have eaten blood shall perish from his people
    28: And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying
    29: Speak to the sons of Israel, saying: Whoever offers a victim of peace offerings to the Lord, let him also offer at the same time a sacrifice, that is, its libations
    30: He shall hold in his hands the fat of the victim, and the breast. And when he will have offered and consecrated both to the Lord, he shall deliver them to the priest
    31: who shall burn the fat upon the altar. But the breast shall be for Aaron and his sons
    32: Likewise also, the right shoulder of the victim of peace offerings shall fall to the priest as first-fruits
    33: Among the sons of Aaron, whoever will have offered the blood and the fat, the same one shall also have the right shoulder for his portion
    34: So then, the breast that is lifted up, and the shoulder that is separated, I have taken from the sons of Israel, from their victims of peace offerings, and I have given these to Aaron the priest and to his sons, as a law in perpetuity, from all the people of Israel
    35: This is the anointing of Aaron and his sons, by the ceremonies of the Lord, in the day when Moses offered them, so that they may fulfill the priesthood
    36: and this is what the Lord instructed to be given to them by the sons of Israel, as a perpetual observance in their generations
    37: This is the law of the holocaust, and of the sacrifice for sin, and for transgression, and for consecration, and for the victims of peace offerings
    38: which the Lord appointed to Moses on mount Sinai, when he commanded the sons of Israel to offer their oblations to the Lord in the desert of Sinai

  Chapter 8.

    1: And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying
    2: Take Aaron, with his sons, their vestments, and the oil of anointing, a calf for sin, two rams, and a basket with unleavened bread
    3: and gather together all the assembly at the door of the tabernacle
    4: And Moses did as the Lord had commanded. And when all the crowd was gathered together before the entrance of the tabernacle
    5: he said: “This is the word that the Lord has ordered to be done.
    6: And immediately, he brought forward Aaron and his sons. And when he had washed them
    7: he vested the high priest with the linen undergarment, wrapped him with the wide belt, and clothed him with the hyacinth tunic, and over it he imposed the ephod
    8: And tying it to the belt, he fitted it to the breastplate, on which was Doctrine and Truth
    9: Also, he wrapped the headdress on his head, and over it, opposite the forehead, he placed the plate of gold, consecrated with sanctification, just as the Lord had instructed him
    10: He also took up the oil of anointing, with which he anointed the tabernacle, along with all of its articles
    11: And when he had sprinkled the altar seven times to sanctify it, he anointed it and all its vessels. And the washtub with its base he sanctified with the oil
    12: And pouring the oil over Aaron’s head, he anointed and consecrated him
    13: Likewise, after he had offered his sons, he vested them with linen tunics, and wrapped them with wide belts, and placed headdresses on them, just as the Lord had ordered
    14: He also offered the calf for sin. And when Aaron and his sons had placed their hands upon its head
    15: he immolated it. And drawing the blood, and dipping his finger in it, he touched the horns of the altar all around. And when it was expiated and sanctified, he poured out the remainder of the blood at its base
    16: Yet truly, the fat which was on the vital organs, and the mesh of the liver, and the two little kidneys with their fat, he burned upon the altar
    17: And the calf with the skin, and the flesh, and the dung, he burned beyond the camp, just as the Lord had instructed
    18: He also offered a ram as a holocaust. And when Aaron and his sons had imposed their hands upon its head
    19: he immolated it, and he poured out its blood around the altar
    20: And cutting the ram into pieces, he burned its head, and the limbs, and the fat in the fire
    21: having first washed the intestines and the feet. And then he burned the whole of the ram upon the altar, because it was a holocaust of most sweet odor to the Lord, just as he had instructed him
    22: He also offered the second ram, as a consecration of priests. And Aaron and his sons placed their hands upon its head
    23: And when Moses had immolated it, taking up some of its blood, he touched the tip of Aaron’s right ear, and the thumb of his right hand, and similarly also his foot
    24: He also offered the sons of Aaron. And when, from the blood of the ram which was immolated, he had touched the tip of the right ear of each one, and the thumbs of their right hands, as well as their feet, he poured out the remainder upon the altar all around
    25: Yet truly, the fat, and the rump, and all the fat that covers the intestines, and the mesh of the liver, and the two kidneys with their fat, and the right shoulder, he separated
    26: Then, taking bread without leaven from the basket of unleavened bread, which was before the Lord, and a cake sprinkled with oil, and a wafer, he placed them upon the fat and the right shoulder
    27: delivering all these to Aaron and his sons. And when they had lifted them up in the sight of the Lord
    28: he received them again from their hands, and he burned them upon the altar of holocaust, because it was an oblation of consecration, as a sweet odor of sacrifice to the Lord
    29: And he took his portion from the ram of consecration, and he lifted up its breast in the sight of the Lord, just as the Lord had instructed him
    30: And taking up the ointment, and the blood that was on the altar, he sprinkled it over Aaron and his vestments, and over his sons and their vestments
    31: And when he had sanctified them with their vestments, he instructed them, saying: “Cook the flesh before the entrance of the tabernacle, and eat it there. Likewise, eat the loaves of consecration, which have been placed in the basket, just as the Lord instructed me, saying: ‘Aaron and his sons shall eat them.
    32: Then whatever will remain of the flesh and the loaves shall be consumed with fire
    33: Also, you shall not exit from the door of the tabernacle for seven days, until the day on which the time of your consecration shall be completed. For in seven days the consecration is finished
    34: even as it has begun at this present time, so that the rite of the sacrifice might be accomplished
    35: Day and night you shall remain in the tabernacle, observing the watches of the Lord, otherwise you shall die. For so it has been commanded to me.
    36: And Aaron and his sons did everything that the Lord spoke by the hand of Moses
