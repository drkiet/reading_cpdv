  Chapter 30.

    1: And Moses explained to the sons of Israel all that the Lord had commanded him
    2: And he said to the leaders of the tribes of the sons of Israel: “This is the word, which the Lord has instructed
    3: If any man makes a vow to the Lord, or binds himself by an oath, he shall not make his word null and void, but all that he has promised, he shall fulfill
    4: If a woman, who is in her father’s house, vows anything, or binds herself by an oath, and she is still in a state of childhood, if her father knew of the vow which she has promised or of the oath by which she has obligated her soul, and he kept silent, she shall be liable to the vow
    5: whatever she has promised or swore, she shall complete in deed
    6: But if her father, as soon as he had heard it, had contradicted it, both her vows and her oaths shall be nullified, neither shall she be held liable to the promise, because her father had contradicted it
    7: If she has a husband, and she has vowed anything, then, once the word has gone out of her mouth, she will have obligated her soul by an oath
    8: On the day that her husband will hear of it, and yet not contradict it, she shall be liable to the vow, and she shall repay whatever she has promised
    9: But if, as soon as he hears it, he contradicts it, then he will have caused her promises, and the words by which she had bound her soul, to be null and void. The Lord will be favorable to her
    10: Widows and divorced women shall repay whatever they have vowed
    11: If a wife in the house of her husband has bound herself by a vow or an oath
    12: if her husband heard it and remained silent, and he did not contradict the promise, she shall repay what she had promised
    13: But if he promptly contradicts it, she shall not be held liable to the promise. For her husband has contradicted it. And the Lord will be favorable to her
    14: If she has vowed or bound herself by oath, in order to afflict her soul by fasting, or by abstaining from other things, it shall be for the arbitration of her husband, as to whether or not she may do it
    15: But if the husband, upon hearing it, remains silent, and he delays judgment until another day, whatever she had vowed or promised, she shall repay, because when he first heard it, he remained silent
    16: And if he contradicted it only sometime after he had known about it, he shall bear his iniquity.
    17: These are the laws which the Lord has appointed to Moses, between a husband and a wife, between a father and a daughter, who is still in the state of childhood or who remains in her father’s house

  Chapter 31.

    1: And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying
    2: “First, avenge the sons of Israel from the Midianites, and then you shall be gathered to your people.
    3: And immediately Moses said: “Arm the men among you for a battle, so that they may be able to fulfill the retribution of the Lord on the Midianites
    4: Let one thousand men be chosen from each tribe of Israel, who shall be sent to war.
    5: And they gave one thousand from each tribe, that is, twelve thousand foot soldiers for battle
    6: And Moses sent them with Phinehas, the son of Eleazar the priest; also, he delivered to him the holy vessels, and the trumpets to sound
    7: And when they had fought against the Midianites and had prevailed, they killed all the men
    8: And they put to death by the sword their kings: Evi, and Rekem, and Zur, and Hur, and Reba, the five leaders of the nation, and also Balaam the son of Beor
    9: And they seized their women and little ones, and all their cattle, and all their goods; whatever they were able to have, they despoiled
    10: Both their cities and their villages, as well as their fortresses, they burned
    11: And they carried away prey from everything that they had seized, both of men and of beasts
    12: And they led these to Moses and Eleazar the priest, and to all the multitude of the sons of Israel. But the remainder of the articles they carried to the camp on the plains of Moab, next to the Jordan, opposite Jericho
    13: Then Moses, and Eleazar the priest, and all the leaders of the assembly went out to meet them beyond the camp
    14: And Moses, being angry with the leaders of the army, and the tribunes, and the centurions, who had arrived from the battle
    15: said: “Why have you spared the females
    16: Are not these the ones who deceived the sons of Israel at the suggestion of Balaam, and who caused you betray the Lord by the sin of Peor, because of which the people also were struck down
    17: Therefore, put to death all of them: whatever is of the male sex, even among the little ones, and cut the throats of those women who have known men by sexual relations
    18: But the young girls, and all female virgins, reserve for yourselves
    19: And remain beyond the camp for seven days. Whoever has killed a man, or who has touched one that was killed, shall be purified on the third day and on the seventh day
    20: And all of the spoils, whether it is a garment, or a vessel, or another useful thing, made from the pelts or hair of goats, or from wood, shall be expiated.
    21: Likewise, Eleazar the priest spoke in this manner to the men of the army who had fought: “This is the precept of the law, which the Lord has commanded Moses
    22: Gold, and silver, and brass, and iron, and lead, and tin
    23: and all that may be able to pass through fire, shall be purified by fire. But whatever is not able to sustain fire shall be sanctified with the waters of expiation
    24: And you shall wash your garments on the seventh day, and, after having been purified, you shall enter the camp.
    25: And the Lord also said to Moses
    26: “Take the sum of those things which were captured, from man even to beast, you and Eleazar the priest, and the leaders of the common people
    27: And you shall divide the prey equally, among those who went out to war and fought, and among the remainder of the multitude
    28: And you shall separate a portion for the Lord from the portion of those who fought and were in the battle: one soul out of five hundred, as much from humans, as from oxen and donkeys and sheep
    29: And you shall give it to Eleazar the priest, because these are the first-fruits of the Lord
    30: Likewise, from the half of the portion belonging to the sons of Israel, you shall receive the fiftieth head of humans, and of oxen, and donkeys, and sheep, and of all living things, and you shall give these to the Levites who stand watch over the care of the tabernacle of the Lord.
    31: And Moses and Eleazar did just as the Lord had instructed
    32: Now the prey which the army had seized was six hundred seventy-five thousand sheep
    33: seventy-two thousand oxen
    34: sixty-one thousand donkeys
    35: and thirty-two thousand human lives, of the female sex, who had not known men
    36: And one half of the portion was given to those who had been in the battle: three hundred thirty-seven thousand five hundred sheep
    37: From these, for the portion of the Lord, there were accounted: six hundred seventy-five sheep
    38: and from the thirty-six thousand oxen, seventy-two oxen
    39: from the thirty thousand five hundred donkeys, sixty-one donkeys
    40: From the sixteen thousand human souls, there fell to the portion of the Lord thirty-two souls
    41: And Moses delivered the number of the first-fruits of the Lord to Eleazar the priest, just as had been commanded of him
    42: from the one half portion belonging to the sons of Israel, which he had separated from the portion of those who had been in the battle
    43: Yet truly, from the one half portion which fell to the remainder of the multitude, that is, from the three hundred thirty-seven thousand five hundred sheep
    44: and from the thirty-six thousand oxen
    45: and from the thirty thousand five hundred donkeys
    46: and from the sixteen thousand persons
    47: Moses took the fiftieth head, and gave it to the Levites who stand watch at the tabernacle of the Lord, just as the Lord had instructed
    48: And when the leaders of the army, and the tribunes, and the centurions had approached Moses, they said
    49: “We, your servants, have taken a census of the number of the fighting men, whom we had under our hand, and indeed not one was lacking
    50: For this reason, we offer as gifts to the Lord whatever gold each one was able to find amid the spoils, in anklets and arm bands, rings and bracelets, and little chains, so that you may intercede for us to the Lord.
    51: And Moses and Eleazar the priest received all the gold in its various kinds
    52: weighing sixteen thousand seven hundred fifty shekels, from the tribunes and the centurions
    53: For whatever each one had taken away in the spoils was his own
    54: And having been accepted, they took it into the tabernacle of the testimony, as a memorial of the sons of Israel before the Lord

  Chapter 32.

    1: Now the sons of Ruben and of Gad had many herds, and their substance in cattle was inestimable. And when they had seen that the lands of Jazer and Gilead were suitable for feeding animals
    2: they went to Moses, and to Eleazar the priest and the leaders of the multitude, and they said
    3: “Ataroth, and Dibon, and Jazer, and Nimrah, Heshbon, and Elealeh, and Sebam, and Nebo, and Beon
    4: the land, which the Lord has struck in the sight of the sons of Israel, is a very fertile region for pasturing animals. And we, your servants, have very many cattle
    5: And so we beseech you, if we have found favor before you, that you give it to us, your subjects, as a possession, and that you not cause us cross the Jordan.
    6: And Moses answered them: “Should your brothers go to battle, while you sit here
    7: Why do you subvert the minds of the sons of Israel, so that they might not dare to cross into the place which the Lord will give to them
    8: Did not your fathers act in the same way, when I sent them from Kadesh-Barnea to explore the land
    9: And when they had gone all the way to the Valley of the Cluster of Grapes, having viewed the entire region, they subverted the hearts of the sons of Israel, so that they would not enter into the parts that the Lord gave to them
    10: And being angry, the Lord swore an oath, saying
    11: ‘These men, who ascended out of Egypt, from twenty years and above, will not see the land, which I have promised under an oath to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. For they were not willing to follow me
    12: except Caleb, the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite, and Joshua the son of Nun; these have fulfilled my will.
    13: And the Lord, being angry against Israel, led them in a course through the desert for forty years, until the entire generation, which had done evil in his sight, was consumed
    14: And behold,” he said, “you have risen up in the place of your fathers, the offshoots and the nurslings of sinful men, in order to augment the fury of the Lord against Israel
    15: But if you are not willing to follow him, he will leave the people behind in the wilderness, and you will have been the cause of all our deaths.
    16: But approaching closer, they said: “We will manufacture sheep pens and cattle stalls, as well as fortified cities, for our little ones
    17: But we ourselves will continue on, armed and girded for battle, before the sons of Israel, until we lead them to their places. Our little ones, and whatever we may be able to have, shall be in walled cities, because of the treachery of the inhabitants
    18: We will not return to our houses, even until the sons of Israel may possess their inheritance
    19: Neither will we seek anything across the Jordan, because we already have our possession on its eastern side.
    20: And Moses said to them: “If you accomplish what you have promised, you may go out, equipped for battle, before the Lord
    21: And let every fighting man cross over the Jordan, until the Lord overthrows his enemies
    22: and all the land is subjected to him. Then you will be guiltless with the Lord and with Israel, and you will obtain the regions which you desire before the Lord
    23: But if you do not do what you have said, no one could doubt that you will have sinned against God. And know this: your sin shall overtake you
    24: Therefore, build cities for your little ones, and pens and stables for your sheep and cattle; and fulfill what you have promised.
    25: And the sons of Gad and of Ruben said to Moses: “We are your servants, we shall do what you, our ruler, orders
    26: We will leave behind our little ones, and our wives, and the sheep and cattle, in the cities of Gilead
    27: And we, your servants, all well-equipped, will go forth to battle, just as you, our ruler, has spoken.
    28: Therefore, Moses instructed Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun, and the princes of the families throughout the tribes of Israel, and he said to them
    29: “If the sons of Gad and the sons of Ruben cross over the Jordan with you, all armed for war before the Lord, and if the land becomes subject to you, give them Gilead as a possession
    30: But if they are not willing to cross with you, armed, into the land of Canaan, then let them receive places among you for their dwellings.
    31: And the sons of Gad and the sons of Ruben responded: “Just as the Lord has spoken to his servants, so shall we do
    32: We will go forth, armed, before the Lord into the land of Canaan; and we acknowledge that we have already received our possession across the Jordan.
    33: And so, Moses gave to the sons of Gad and of Ruben, and to half the tribe of Manasseh, the son of Joseph, the kingdom of Sihon, king of the Amorites, and the kingdom of Og, king of Bashan, and their land with its surrounding cities
    34: Therefore, the sons of Gad built up Dibon, and Ataroth, and Aroer
    35: and Atroth and Shophan, and Jazer, and Jogbehah
    36: and Beth-Nimrah, and Beth-Haran, as fortified cities with pens for their cattle
    37: Yet truly, the sons of Ruben built up Heshbon, and Elealeh, and Kiriathaim
    38: and Nebo, and Baal-meon (their names having been changed) and Sibmah, appointing names for the cities which they had built
    39: Moreover, the sons of Machir, the son of Manasseh, continued on within Gilead, and they devastated it, putting to death its inhabitant, the Amorite
    40: Therefore, Moses gave the land of Gilead to Machir, the son of Manasseh, and he lived in it
    41: But Jair, the son of Manasseh, went out and occupied its villages, which he called Havoth Jair, that is, the Villages of Jair
    42: Likewise, Nobah went forth and captured Kenath with its villages. And he called it by his own name, Nobah
