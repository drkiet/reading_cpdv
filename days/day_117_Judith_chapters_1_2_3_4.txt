Day 117:

Reading Judith, chapters ['1', '2', '3', '4']:

  Chapter 1.

    1: And so Arphaxad, king of the Medes, subjugated many nations under his authority, and he built a very powerful city, which he called Ecbatana
    2: From stones, cut and squared, he made its walls: seventy cubits in height and thirty cubits in breadth. And, in truth, he set its towers one hundred cubits in height
    3: In fact, at its corners, each side was extended for the space of twenty feet. And he set its gates according to the height of the towers
    4: And he glorified it, in its power, with the force of his army and with the glory of his chariots
    5: Thereafter, in the twelfth year of his reign, Nebuchadnezzar, king of the Assyrians, who reigned in Nineveh the great city, fought against Arphaxad and prevailed over him
    6: in the great plain, which is called Ragae, near the Euphrates, and the Tigris, and the Hydaspes, at the encampment of Arioch, king of the Elymaeans
    7: Then the kingdom of Nebuchadnezzar was exalted, and his heart was elevated. And he sent to all who dwelt in Cilicia, and Damascus, and Lebanon
    8: and to the nations that are in Carmel and Kedar, and to the inhabitants of Galilee, in the great plain of Esdrelon
    9: and to all who were in Samaria and across the river Jordan, even to Jerusalem and to all the land of Jesse, until one passes through to the borders of Ethiopia
    10: To all these, Nebuchadnezzar, king of the Assyrians, sent messengers
    11: whom they all with one mind contradicted, and they sent them back empty, and they rejected them without honor
    12: Then king Nebuchadnezzar, being indignant against all that land, swore by his throne and his kingdom that he would defend himself against all those regions

  Chapter 2.

    1: In the thirteenth year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar, on the twenty-second day of the first month, the word went forth from the house of Nebuchadnezzar, king of the Assyrians, that he would defend himself
    2: And he called all the native leaders, and all the commanders, and his officers of war, and he met with them in his secret council
    3: And he said to them that his thoughts were to subjugate all the earth to his authority
    4: And when this saying pleased them all, king Nebuchadnezzar called Holofernes, the leader of his military
    5: And he said to him: “Go out against all the kingdoms of the west, and against those in particular who showed contempt for my authority
    6: Your eye must not spare any kingdom, and all the fortified cities you will subjugate to me.
    7: Then Holofernes called the commanders and the magistrates of the army of the Assyrians. And he numbered men for the expedition, just as the king had instructed him: one hundred and twenty thousand foot-soldiers, and twelve thousand archers on horseback
    8: And he caused his entire expeditionary force to go ahead with an innumerable multitude of camels, with whatever was needed in abundance for the armies, and with herds of cattle, and flocks of sheep, which could not be numbered
    9: He appointed grain to be prepared from all of Syria, as he passed through it
    10: In fact, he took up gold and silver from the house of the king in great abundance
    11: And he set out, he and all the army, with the four-horse chariots, and horsemen, and archers. And they covered the face of the earth like locusts
    12: And when he had crossed over the borders of the Assyrians, he came to the great mountains of Ange, which are on the left of Cilicia. And he ascended to all their castles, and he prevailed over all the fortifications
    13: Moreover, he broke open the renowned city of Melothus, and he pillaged all the sons of Tarshish, and the sons of Ishmael, who were opposite the face of the desert and to the south of the land of Cellon
    14: And he crossed over the Euphrates and came into Mesopotamia. And he crushed all the lofty cities that were there, from the torrent of Mambre, even until one passes through to the sea
    15: And he occupied its furthest regions, from Cilicia all the way to the coastlines of Japheth, which are towards the south
    16: And he carried away all the sons of Midian, and he plundered them in all their wealthy regions. And all who resisted him, he slew with the edge of the sword
    17: And after these things, he descended to the plains of Damascus, in the days of the harvest, and he set fire to all the crops, and he caused all the trees and the vineyards to be cut down
    18: And the fear of them fell upon all the inhabitants of the land

  Chapter 3.

    1: Then the kings as well as the princes of the provinces sent their emissaries from all of the cities: from Syria, particularly Mesopotamia, and Syria Sobal, and Libya as well as Cilicia. These, upon coming to Holofernes, said
    2: “Let your indignation concerning us cease. For it is better for us to live in service to Nebuchadnezzar, the great king, and to become subject to you, rather than to die, even though we may have to suffer our condemnation into the annihilation of slavery
    3: All our cities and all our possessions, all mountains, and hills, and fields, and herds of cattle, and flocks of sheep, and goats, and horses, and camels, and all our resources and families are in your sight
    4: Let all that we have be subject to your law
    5: We, and our sons, are your servants
    6: Come to us as a peaceful lord, and use our service, just as it pleases you.
    7: Then he descended from the mountains with horsemen, in great power, and he took charge of every city and of every inhabitant of the land
    8: And, from all the cities, he took for himself auxiliaries: strong men and well-chosen for war
    9: And such a dread lay upon those provinces, that the leading and honored inhabitants of all the cities, together with the people, went out to meet him at his arrival
    10: They received him with garlands and lamps; they were led by choirs with timbrels and flutes
    11: Yet, not even by doing these things were they able to mitigate the ferocity of his chest
    12: For he both destroyed their cities and cut down their sacred groves
    13: For king Nebuchadnezzar had instructed him to exterminate all the gods of the earth, evidently so that he alone might be called ‘god’ by those nations which were able to be subjugated by the power of Holofernes
    14: But when he had passed through Syria Sobal, and all of Apamea, and all Mesopotamia, he came to the Idumeans in the land of Gibeah
    15: And he took their cities, and he sat there for thirty days, during which days he instructed all the troops of his army to regroup

  Chapter 4.

    1: Then, upon hearing these things, the sons of Israel, who dwelt in the land of Judah, were very afraid before his face
    2: Trembling and horror invaded their senses, lest he should do the same thing to Jerusalem and to the temple of the Lord that he had done to other cities and their temples
    3: And they sent into all of Samaria, and by an indirect route even to Jericho, and they seized in advance all the tops of the mountains
    4: And they surrounded their villages with walls, and they gathered together grain in preparation for the fight
    5: And then Eliachim the priest wrote to all who were opposite Esdrelon, which is opposite the face of the great plain near Dothain, and to all whom he would be able to reach through a passable way
    6: that they should hold the ascents of the mountains, through which there might be any passage able to reach Jerusalem, and that they should keep watch where the passage was narrow, wherever possible, between the mountains
    7: And the sons of Israel did just as Eliachim, the priest of the Lord, had appointed them
    8: And all the people cried out to the Lord with great urgency, and they humbled their souls with fastings, and prayers, both they and their wives
    9: And the priests clothed themselves with haircloths, and they prostrated the little children opposite the face of the temple of the Lord, and they covered the altar of the Lord with haircloth
    10: And they cried out to the Lord God of Israel with one accord, lest their children should be given over as prey, and their wives into distribution, and their cities into extermination, and their holy things into defilement, and so that they might not become the disgrace of the Gentiles
    11: Then Eliachim, the high priest of the Lord, traveled all around Israel, and he was talking to them
    12: saying: “Know that the Lord will heed your prayers, if you continue to persevere in fastings and prayers in the sight of the Lord
    13: Recall that Moses, the servant of the Lord, overcame Amalek, who trusted in his own strength, and in his power, and in his army, and in his bronze shields, and in his swift chariots, and in his horsemen. He overcame him, not by fighting with iron, but by pleading with holy prayers
    14: So will it be with all the enemies of Israel, if you persevere in this work that you have begun.
    15: Therefore, by this exhortation and his prayer to the Lord, they continued in the sight of the Lord
    16: so that even those who offered holocausts to the Lord, offered the sacrifices to the Lord girded with haircloths, and there were ashes upon their heads
    17: And they all begged God with their whole heart, that he would visit his people Israel
