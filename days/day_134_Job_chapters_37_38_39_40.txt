Day 134:

Reading Job, chapters ['37', '38', '39', '40']:

  Chapter 37.

    1: At this, my heart became frightened, and it has been moved from its place
    2: Pay close attention to the alarm of his voice and to the sound that proceeds from his mouth
    3: He beholds everything under the heavens, and his light reaches beyond the ends of the earth
    4: After this, a noise will sound; he will thunder with the voice of his greatness, and it will not be tracked down, yet his voice will be obeyed
    5: God will thunder with his voice miraculously, for he performs great and unsearchable things
    6: He commands the snow to descend on earth, and the winter rains, and the shower of his strength
    7: He signs the hand of all men, so that each one may know his works
    8: The beast will enter his hiding-place, and he will remain in his cave
    9: From the interior, a storm will come forth, and a cold winter from the north
    10: As God breathes out, frost forms, and the waters are poured forth very widely again
    11: Crops desire clouds, and the clouds scatter their light
    12: It shines all around, wherever the will of him that governs them will lead, to anywhere he will command, over the whole face of the earth
    13: whether in one tribe, or in his own region, or in whatever place of his mercy that he will order them to be found
    14: Listen to these things, Job. Stand up and consider the wonders of God
    15: Do you know when God ordered the rains, so as to show the light of his clouds
    16: Do you know the great paths of the clouds, and the perfect sciences
    17: Are not your garments hot, when the south wind blows across the land
    18: Perhaps you have made the heavens with him, which are very solid, as if they had been cast from brass
    19: Reveal to us what we should say to him, for, of course, we are wrapped in darkness
    20: Who will explain to him the things that I am saying? Even while a man is still speaking, he will be devoured
    21: Although they do not see the light, the air will be thickened suddenly into clouds, and the wind, passing by, will drive them away
    22: Riches arrive from the north, and fearful praise reaches out to God
    23: We are not worthy to be able to find him. Great in strength, great in judgment, great in justice: he is indescribable
    24: Therefore, men will fear him, and all those who seem to themselves to be wise, will not dare to contemplate him

  Chapter 38.

    1: But the Lord, responding to Job from a whirlwind, said
    2: Who is this that wraps sentences in unskilled words
    3: Gird your waist like a man. I will question you, and you must answer me
    4: Where were you, when I set the foundations of the earth? Tell me, if you have understanding
    5: Who set its measurements, if you know, or who stretched a line over it
    6: Upon what have its bases been grounded, and who set forth its cornerstone
    7: when the morning stars praised me together, and all the sons of God made a joyful noise
    8: Who enclosed the sea with doors, when it broke forth as if issuing from the womb
    9: when I stationed a cloud as its garment and wrapped it in a mist as if swaddling an infant
    10: I encircled it with my limits, and I positioned its bars and doors
    11: And I said: “This far you will approach, and you will proceed no further, and here you will break your swelling waves.
    12: Did you, after your birth, command the birth of the sun and show the sunrise its place
    13: And did you hold the extremities of the earth, shaking them, and have you shaken the impious out of it
    14: The seal will be restored like clay, and it will remain in place like a garment
    15: From the impious, the light will be taken away, and the exalted arm will be broken
    16: Have you entered the depths of the sea, and have you taken a walk in the uttermost parts of the abyss
    17: Have the gates of death been opened to you, and have you seen the doors of darkness
    18: Have you considered the breadth of the earth? If you know all things, reveal them to me
    19: Which is the way that holds the light, and which is the place of darkness
    20: In this way, you might lead each thing to its final place, and understand the paths of its house
    21: So then, did you know when you were to be born? And did you know the number of your days
    22: Have you been admitted into the storehouses of the snows, and have you gazed upon the stockpile of the brimstone
    23: which I have prepared for the time of the enemy, for the day of the battle and the war
    24: In what way is the light scattered, and the heat distributed, over the earth
    25: Who gave a course to the rainstorms, and a path to the resounding thunder
    26: so that it would rain on the earth far from man, in the wilderness where no mortal lingers
    27: so that it would fill impassable and desolate places, and would bring forth green plants
    28: Who is the father of rain, or who conceived the drops of dew
    29: From whose womb did the ice proceed, and who created the frost from the air
    30: The waters are hardened to become like stone, and the surface of the abyss freezes over
    31: Will you have the strength to join together the sparkling stars of the Pleiades, or are you able to disperse the circling of Arcturus
    32: Can you bring forth the morning star, in its time, and make the evening star rise over the sons of the earth
    33: Do you know the order of heaven, and can you explain its rules here on the earth
    34: Can you lift up your voice to the clouds, so that an onslaught of waters will cover you
    35: Can you send forth lightning bolts, and will they go, and on returning, say to you: “Here we are?
    36: Who placed discernment in the guts of man, or who gave the rooster intelligence
    37: Who can describe the rules of the heavens, or who can put to rest the harmony of heaven
    38: When was the dust cast to become the earth, and when were its clods fastened together
    39: Will you seize prey for the lioness, and will you sustain the lives of her young
    40: as they rest in their dens or lie in wait in pits
    41: Who provides the raven with its meal, when her chicks cry out to God, as they wander around because they have no food

  Chapter 39.

    1: Do you know at what time the wild goats have given birth among the rocks, or do you observe the deer when they go into labor
    2: Have you numbered the months since their conception, and do you know at what time they gave birth
    3: They bend themselves for their offspring, and they give birth, and they emit roars
    4: Their young are weaned and go out to feed; they depart and do not return to them
    5: Who has set the wild ass free, and who has released his bonds
    6: I have given a house in solitude to him, and his tabernacle is in the salted land
    7: He despises the crowded city; he does not pay attention to the bellow of the tax collector
    8: He looks around the mountains of his pasture, and he searches everywhere for green plants
    9: Will the rhinoceros be willing to serve you, and will he remain in your stall
    10: Can you detain the rhinoceros with your harness to plough for you, and will he loosen the soil of the furrows behind you
    11: Will you put your faith in his great strength, and delegate your labors to him
    12: Will you trust him to return to you the seed, and to gather it on your drying floor
    13: The wing of the ostrich is like the wings of the heron, and of the hawk
    14: When she leaves eggs behind in the earth, will you perhaps warm them in the dust
    15: She forgets that feet may trample them, or that the beasts of the field may shatter them
    16: She is hardened against her young, as if they were not hers; she has labored in vain, with no fear compelling her
    17: For God has deprived her of wisdom; neither has he given her understanding
    18: Yet, when the time is right, she raises her wings on high; she ridicules the horse and his rider
    19: Will you supply strength to the horse, or envelope his throat with neighing
    20: Will you alarm him as the locusts do? His panic is revealed by the display of his nostrils
    21: He digs at the earth with his hoof; he jumps around boldly; he advances to meet armed men
    22: He despises fear; he does not turn away from the sword
    23: Above him, the quiver rattles, the spear and the shield shake
    24: Seething and raging, he drinks up the earth; neither does he pause when the blast of the trumpet sounds
    25: When he hears the bugle, he says, “Ha!” He smells the battle from a distance, the exhortation of the officers, and the battle cry of the soldiers
    26: Does the hawk grow feathers by means of your wisdom, spreading her wings towards the south
    27: Will the eagle lift herself up at your command and make her nest in steep places
    28: She dwells among the rocks, and she lingers among broken boulders and inaccessible cliffs
    29: From there, she looks for food, and her eyes catch sight of it from far away
    30: Her young will drink blood, and wherever the carcass will be, she is there immediately
    31: And the Lord continued, and he said to Job
    32: Will he who contends with God be so easily silenced? Certainly, he who argues with God must also respond to him
    33: Then Job answered the Lord, saying
    34: What could I possibly answer, since I have been speaking thoughtlessly? I will place my hand over my mouth
    35: One thing I have spoken, which I wish I had not said; and another, to which I will add no more

  Chapter 40.

    1: But the Lord, answering Job out of the whirlwind, said
    2: Gird your waist like a man. I will question you, and you must answer me
    3: Will you make my judgment null and void; and will you condemn me so that you may be justified
    4: And do you have an arm like God, or a voice like thunder
    5: Envelop yourself with splendor, and raise yourself up on high, and be glorious, and put on splendid garments
    6: Scatter the arrogant with your wrath, and, when you see all the arrogant, humble them
    7: Look down upon each of the arrogant and confound them, and crush the impious in their place
    8: Hide them in the dust together and plunge their faces into the pit
    9: Then I will confess that your right hand is able to save you
    10: Behold, the behemoth, whom I created along with you, eats hay like an ox
    11: His strength is in his lower back, and his power is in the center of his abdomen
    12: He draws up his tail like a cedar; the sinews of his thighs have been drawn together
    13: His bones are like pipes of brass; his cartilage is like plates of iron
    14: He is the beginning of the ways of God, who made him; he will use him as his sword
    15: The mountains bring forth grass for him; all the beasts of the field will play there
    16: He sleeps in the shadows, under the cover of branches, and in moist places
    17: The shadows cover his shadow; the willows of the brook will encircle him
    18: Behold, he will drink a river and not be amazed, and he has confidence that the Jordan could flow into his mouth
    19: He will seize him through his eyes, as if with a hook, and he will bore through his nostrils, as if with stakes
    20: Can you draw out the leviathan with a hook, and can you bind his tongue with a cord
    21: Can you place a ring in his nose, or bore through his jaw with an arm band
    22: Will he offer many prayers to you, or speak to you quietly
    23: Will he form a covenant with you, and will you accept him as a servant forever
    24: Will you play with him as with a bird, or tether him for your handmaids
    25: Will your friends cut him into pieces, will dealers distribute him
    26: Will you fill up bags with his hide, and let his head be used as a home for fishes
    27: Place your hand upon him; remember the battle and speak no more
    28: Behold, his hope will fail him, and in the sight of all, he will be thrown down
