Day 211:

Reading Isaiah, chapters ['25', '26', '27', '28']:

  Chapter 25.

    1: O Lord, you are my God! I will exalt you, and I will confess your name. For you have accomplished miracles. Your plan, from antiquity, is faithful. Amen
    2: For you have appointed a city as a tomb, a strong city for ruination, a house of foreigners: so that it may not be a city, and so that it may not be rebuilt forever
    3: Concerning this, a strong people will praise you; a city with a robust people will fear you
    4: For you have been the strength of the poor, the strength of the indigent in his tribulation, a refuge from the whirlwind, a shadow from the heat. For the spirit of the mighty is like a whirlwind striking against a wall
    5: You will bring low the uprising of foreigners,  just as heat brings thirst. And like heat under a torrential cloud, you will cause the offshoot of the strong to wither away
    6: And the Lord of hosts will cause all the peoples on this mountain to feast on fatness, to feast on wine, a fatness full of marrow, a purified wine
    7: And he will cast down violently, on this mountain, the face of the chains, with which all peoples had been bound, and the net, with which all nations had been covered
    8: He will violently cast down death forever. And the Lord God will take away the tears from every face, and he will take away the disgrace of his people from the entire earth. For the Lord has spoken it
    9: And they will say in that day: “Behold, this is our God! We have waited for him, and he will save us. This is the Lord! We have endured for him. We will exult and rejoice in his salvation.
    10: For the hand of the Lord will rest upon this mountain. And Moab will be trampled under him, just as stubble is worn away by a wagon
    11: And he will extend his hands under him, like a swimmer extending his hands to swim. And he will bring down his glory with a clap of his hands
    12: And the fortifications of your sublime walls will fall, and be brought low, and be torn down to the ground, even to the dust

  Chapter 26.

    1: In that day, this canticle will be sung in the land of Judah. Within it will be set the city of our strength: Zion, a savior, a wall with a bulwark
    2: Open the gates, and let the just people who guard the truth enter
    3: The old error has gone away. You will serve peace: peace, for we have hoped in you
    4: You have trusted in the Lord for all eternity, in the Lord God almighty forever
    5: For he will bend down those living in the heights. He will bring low the lofty city. He will lower it, even to the ground. He will tear it down, even to the dust
    6: The foot will tread it down: the feet of the poor, the steps of the indigent
    7: The path of the just is upright; the difficult path of the just is right to walk in
    8: And in the path of your judgments, O Lord, we have endured for you. Your name and your remembrance are the desire of the soul
    9: My soul has desired you in the night. But I will also watch for you with my spirit, in my inmost heart, from the morning. When you accomplish your judgments upon the earth, the inhabitants of the world will learn justice
    10: Let us take pity on the impious one, but he will not learn justice. In the land of the holy ones, he has done iniquity, and so he will not see the glory of the Lord
    11: Lord, let your hand be exalted, and let them not see it. May the envious people see and be confounded. And may fire devour your enemies
    12: Lord, you will give us peace. For all our works have been wrought for us by you
    13: O Lord our God, other lords have possessed us apart from you, but in you alone let us remember your name
    14: Let not the dead live; let not the giants rise up again. For this reason, you have visited and destroyed them, and you have perished all remembrance of them
    15: You have been lenient to the people, O Lord, lenient to the people. But have you been glorified? You have removed all the limits of the earth
    16: Lord, they have sought you in anguish. Your doctrine was with them, amid the tribulation of murmuring
    17: Like a woman who has conceived and is approaching the time for delivery, who, in anguish, cries out in her pains, so have we become before your face, O Lord
    18: We have conceived, and it is as if we were in labor, but we have given birth to wind. We have not brought forth salvation on the earth. For this reason, the inhabitants of the earth have not fallen
    19: Your dead shall live. My slain will rise again. Be awakened, and give praise, you who live in the dust! For your dew is the dew of the light, and you shall be dragged down to the land of the giants, to ruination
    20: Go, my people! Enter your chambers. Close your doors behind you. Conceal yourselves for a very brief time, until the indignation has passed over you
    21: For behold, the Lord will go forth from his place, so that he may visit the iniquity of each inhabitant of the earth against him. And the earth will reveal its blood, and it will no longer cover its slain

  Chapter 27.

    1: In that day, the Lord will visit, with his harsh and great and strong sword, against Leviathan, the barred serpent, and against Leviathan, the twisted serpent, and he will slay the whale that is in the sea
    2: In that day, the vineyard of pure wine will sing to them
    3: I am the Lord, who watches over it. I will suddenly give drink to it. I will watch over it, night and day, lest perhaps someone visit against it
    4: Indignation is not mine. Who will be a thorn and a brier to me in battle? I will advance against them. I set them on fire together
    5: Or will he, instead, take hold of my strength? Will he make peace with me? Will she make peace with me
    6: As they advance with violence against Jacob, Israel will flourish and spring forth, and they will fill the face of the world with offspring
    7: Has he struck him with the scourge that he himself used to strike others? Or has he killed in the manner that he himself used to kill his victims
    8: You will judge this by comparing one measure to another, when he has been cast out. He has decided this, by his stern spirit, for the day of heat
    9: Therefore, concerning this, the iniquity of the house of Jacob will be forgiven. And this is the reward of all: that their sin be taken away, when he will have made all the stones of the altar to be like crushed cinders. For the sacred groves and the shrines shall not stand
    10: For the fortified city will be desolate. The shining city will be abandoned and will be left behind like a desert. In that place, the calf will pasture, and in that place, he will lie down, and he will feed from its summits
    11: Its harvest will be crushed by dryness. Women will arrive and teach it, for it is not a wise people. Because of this, he who made it will not take pity on it, and he who formed it will not spare it
    12: And this shall be: in that day, the Lord will strike, from the channel of the river, even to the torrent of Egypt. And you shall be gathered together, one by one, O sons of Israel
    13: And this shall be: in that day, a noise will be made with a great trumpet. And those who had been lost will approach from the land of the Assyrians, with those who had been outcasts in the land of Egypt. And they will adore the Lord, on the holy mountain, in Jerusalem

  Chapter 28.

    1: Woe to the crown of arrogance, to the inebriated of Ephraim, and to the falling flower, the glory of his exultation, to those who were at the top of the very fat valley, staggering from wine
    2: Behold, the Lord is powerful and steadfast, like a storm of hail, like a crushing whirlwind, like the force of many waters, inundating, sent forth over a spacious land
    3: The arrogant crown of the inebriated of Ephraim will be trampled under foot
    4: And the falling flower, the glory of his exultation, who is at the summit of the fat valley, will be like a premature fruit before the ripeness of autumn, which, when the onlooker beholds it, as soon he takes it in his hand, he will devour it
    5: In that day, the Lord of hosts will be the crown of glory and the wreath of exultation for the remnant of his people
    6: And he will be the spirit of judgment for those who sit in judgment, and the strength of those who return from war to the gates
    7: Yet truly, these also have been ignorant due to wine, and they have gone astray due to inebriation. The priest and the prophet have been ignorant because of inebriation. They have been absorbed by wine. They have staggered in drunkenness. They have not known the One who sees. They have been ignorant of judgment
    8: For all the tables have been filled with vomit and filth, so much so that there was no place left
    9: To whom will he teach knowledge? And to whom will he grant an understanding of what is heard? To those who have been weaned from the milk, who have been pulled away from the breasts
    10: So then: command, and command again; command, and command again; expect, and expect again; a little here, and a little there
    11: For with the speech of lips and with a different language, he will speak to this people
    12: He said to them: “This is my rest. Refresh the weary,” and, “This is my refreshment.” And yet they were unwilling to listen
    13: And so, the word of the Lord to them will be: “Command, and command again; command, and command again; expect, and expect again; a little here, and a little there,” so that they may go forward and fall backward, and so that they may be broken and ensnared and captured
    14: Because of this, listen to the word of the Lord, you mocking men, who lord it over my people who are at Jerusalem
    15: For you have said: “We struck a deal with death, and we formed a pact with Hell. When the inundating scourge passes through, it will not overwhelm us. For we have placed our hope in lies, and we are protected by what is false.
    16: For this reason, thus says the Lord God: Behold, I will set a stone within the foundations of Zion, a tested stone, a cornerstone, a precious stone, which has been established in the foundation: whoever trusts in him need not hurry
    17: And I will establish judgment in weights, and justice in measures. And a hailstorm will overturn hope in what is false; and waters will inundate its protection
    18: And your deal with death will be abolished, and your pact with Hell will not stand. When the inundating scourge passes through, you will be trampled down by it
    19: Whenever it passes through, it will take you away. For, at first light of morning, it will pass through, in the day and in the night, and vexation alone will make you understand what you hear
    20: For the bed has been narrowed, so much so that one alone would fall out, and the short blanket is not able to cover two
    21: For the Lord will stand, just as at the mountain of divisions. He will be angry, just as in the valley which is in Gibeon, so that he may accomplish his work, his strange work, so that he may complete his work, his work which is foreign even to him
    22: And now, do not be willing to mock, lest your chains be tightened. For I have heard, from the Lord, the God of hosts, about the consummation and the abridgement concerning the entire earth
    23: Pay close attention, and listen to my voice! Attend and hear my eloquence
    24: Would the plowman, after plowing all day so that he may sow, instead cut open and hoe his soil
    25: Will he not, when he has made the surface level, sow coriander, and scatter cumin, and plant wheat in rows, and barley, and millet, and vetch in their places
    26: For he will be instructed in judgment; his God will teach him
    27: For coriander cannot be threshed with a saw, and a cartwheel cannot revolve over cumin. Instead, coriander is shaken out with a stick, and cumin with a staff
    28: But grain for bread must be crushed. Truly, the thresher cannot thresh it unceasingly, and the cartwheel can neither disrupt it, nor break it with its surface
    29: And this has gone forth from the Lord, the God of hosts, so that he may accomplish his miraculous plan and magnify justice
