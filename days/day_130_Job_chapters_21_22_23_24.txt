Day 130:

Reading Job, chapters ['21', '22', '23', '24']:

  Chapter 21.

    1: Then Job responded by saying
    2: I beseech you to hear my words and to do penance
    3: Permit me, and I will speak, and afterwards, if you see fit, you can laugh at my words
    4: Is my dispute against man, so that I would have no reason to be discouraged
    5: Listen to me and be astonished, and place a finger over your mouth
    6: As for me, when I think it over, I am afraid, and trembling convulses my body
    7: Why then do the impious live, having been lifted up and strengthened with riches
    8: They see their offspring continue before them: a commotion of close relatives and of children’s children in their sight
    9: Their houses have been secure and peaceable, and there is no staff of God over them
    10: Their cattle have conceived and have not miscarried; their cow has given birth and is not deprived of her newborn
    11: Their little ones go out like a flock, and their children jump around playfully
    12: They take up the timbrel and the lyre, and they rejoice at the sound of the organ
    13: Their days are prolonged in wealth, yet, in an instant, they descend into hell
    14: Who has said to God, “Depart from us, for we do not want the knowledge of your ways
    15: Who is the Almighty that we should serve him? And how is it helpful to us if we pray to him?
    16: It is true that their good things are not in their power. May the counsel of the impious be far from me
    17: How often will the lamp of the wicked be extinguished, and a deluge overtake them, and how often will he distribute the afflictions of his wrath
    18: They will be like chaff before the face of the wind, and like ashes that the whirlwind scatters
    19: God will preserve the grief of the father for his sons, and, when he repays, then he will understand
    20: His eyes will see his own destruction, and he will drink from the wrath of the Almighty
    21: For what does he care what happens to his house after him, or if the number of its months are reduced by half
    22: Can anyone teach holy knowledge to God, who judges the exalted
    23: This one dies strong and healthy, rich and happy
    24: His gut is full of fat and his bones are moistened with marrow
    25: In truth, another dies in bitterness of soul, without any resources
    26: And yet they will sleep together in the dust, and worms will cover them
    27: Surely, I know your thoughts and your sinful judgments against me
    28: For you say, “Where is the house of the ruler, and where are the tabernacles of the impious?
    29: Ask any passerby whom you wish, and you will realize that he understands these same things
    30: that the evil-doer is reserved for the day of destruction, and he will be led to the day of wrath
    31: Who will reprove his way to his face, and who will repay him for what he has done
    32: He will be led to the tomb, and he will remain awake in the chaos of the dead
    33: He has been found acceptable to the banks of the River of Lamentation, and he will draw any man towards him, and there are countless before him
    34: Therefore, how long will you console me in vain, when your answer is shown to be repugnant to truth

  Chapter 22.

    1: Then Eliphaz the Themanite responded by saying
    2: Can man be compared with God, even if he were perfect in knowledge
    3: What advantage is it to God, if you were just? Or what do you provide for him, if your way should be immaculate
    4: Will he reprove you and take you to judgment for being afraid
    5: and not because of your many evil deeds and your infinite unfairness
    6: For you have taken away the collateral of your brothers without cause, and stripped them naked of their clothing
    7: You have not given water to the weary; you have taken bread away from the hungry
    8: By the strength of your arm, you took possession of the land, and you retain it by being the strongest
    9: You have sent widows away empty, and you have crushed the shoulders of orphans
    10: Because of this, you are surrounded by traps, and unexpected fears will disturb you
    11: And did you think that you would not see darkness and that you were not to be overwhelmed by the on-rush of overflowing waters
    12: Have you not considered that God is higher than the heavens and is lifted above the height of the stars
    13: And you say: “Well, what does God know?” and, “He judges, as if through a fog,
    14: and, “The clouds are his hiding-place,” and, “He does not examine us closely,” and, “He makes his rounds at the limits of the heavens.
    15: Do you not want to tend the path of the ages, which wicked men have spurned
    16: These were taken away before their time, and a flood overthrew their foundation
    17: They said to God, “Withdraw from us,” and they treated the Almighty as if he could do nothing
    18: though he had filled their houses with good things. May their way of thinking be far from me
    19: The just will see and will rejoice, and the innocent will mock them
    20: Has not their haughtiness been cut down, and has not fire devoured the remnants of them
    21: So, repose yourself with him and be at peace, and, in this way, you will have the best fruits
    22: Accept the law from his mouth, and place his words in your heart
    23: If you will return to the Almighty, you will be rebuilt, and you will put sinfulness far from your tabernacle
    24: He will give you stone in place of dirt, and torrents of gold in place of stone
    25: And the Almighty will be against your enemies, and silver will be gathered together for you
    26: Then will you flock together in delight over the Almighty, and you will lift up your face to God
    27: You will plead with him, and he will listen to you, and you will pay your vows
    28: You will decide on something, and it will come to you, and the light will shine in your ways
    29: For he who had been humbled, will be in glory; and he who will lower his eyes, will be the one saved
    30: The innocent will be saved, and he will be saved with purity in his hands

  Chapter 23.

    1: Then Job answered by saying
    2: Now again my conversation is in bitterness, and the force of my scourging weighs more heavily on me because of my mourning
    3: Who will grant me that I might know and find him, and that I may approach even to his throne
    4: I would place judgment before his eye, and my mouth would fill with criticism
    5: so that I may know the words that he will answer me and understand what he will say to me
    6: I do not want him to contend with me with much strength, nor to overwhelm me with the bulk of his greatness
    7: Let him show fairness in response to me, and let my judgment reach to victory
    8: If I go to the east, he does not appear; if I go to the west, I will not understand him
    9: If I turn to the left, what can I do? I will not take hold of him. If I turn myself to the right, I will not see him
    10: Truly, he knows my way and has tested me like gold that passes through fire
    11: My feet have been following his footsteps; I have kept to his way and have not strayed from it
    12: I have not withdrawn from the commands of his lips, and the words of his mouth I have hidden in my sinews
    13: For he is alone, and no one is able to disturb his intention; and whatever his spirit wills, that he accomplishes
    14: And when he fulfills his will in me, many other similar ones will also be present with him
    15: And, for this reason, I have been troubled at his presence, and, when I consider him, I am approached by fear
    16: God has weakened my heart, and the Almighty has confused me
    17: Yet I have not perished because of the threatening darkness, nor has gloom covered my face

  Chapter 24.

    1: The times are not hidden from the Almighty; even those who know him, do not know his days
    2: Some have crossed the boundaries, plundered the flocks, and given them pasture
    3: They have driven away the donkey of orphans, and have taken the cow from the widow as collateral
    4: They have undermined the way of the poor, and have pressed together the meek of the earth
    5: Others, like wild asses in the desert, go forth to their work; by watching for prey, they obtain bread for their children
    6: They reap a field that is not their own, and they harvest a vineyard that they have taken by force
    7: They send men away naked, having taken the clothing of those who have no covering in the cold
    8: these are wet with the mountain rain, and, having no covering, they embrace the rocks
    9: They have used violence to deprive orphans, and they have robbed the poor common people
    10: From the naked and those who do not have enough clothing, and from the hungry, they have taken away sheaves of grain
    11: They take their midday rest among the stockpiles of those who, though they have trodden the winepresses, suffer thirst
    12: In the cities, they caused the men to groan and the spirit of the wounded to cry out, and so God does not allow this to go unpunished
    13: They have been rebellious against the light; they have not known his ways, nor have they returned by his paths
    14: The killer of men rises at first light; he executes the destitute and the poor, but, in truth, he is like a thief in the night
    15: The eye of the adulterer waits for darkness, saying, “No eye will see me,” and he covers his face
    16: He passes through houses in the nighttime, just as they had agreed among themselves in the daytime; and they are ignorant of the light
    17: If sunrise should suddenly appear, it is treated by them like the shadow of death; and they walk in darkness, as if in light
    18: He is nimble on the surface of water. His place on land is to be accursed. May he not walk by way of the vineyards
    19: May he cross from the snowy waters to excessive heat, and his sin, all the way to hell
    20: Let mercy forget him. His charm is worms. Let him not be remembered, but instead be broken like an unfruitful tree
    21: For he has fed on the barren, who does not bear fruit, and he has not done good to the widow
    22: He has pulled down the strong by his strength, and, when he stands up, he will not have trust in his life
    23: God has given him a place for repentance, and he abuses it with arrogance, but his eyes are upon his ways
    24: They are lifted up for a little while, but they will not continue, and they will be brought low, just like all things, and they will be taken away, and, like the tops of the ears of grain, they will be crushed
    25: But, if this is not so, who is able to prove to me that I have lied and to place my words before God
