Day 233:

Reading Jeremiah, chapters ['45', '46', '47', '48']:

  Chapter 45.

    1: The word that Jeremiah the prophet spoke to Baruch, the son of Neriah, when he had written these words in a book, from the mouth of Jeremiah, in the fourth year of Jehoiakim, the son of Josiah, the king of Judah, saying
    2: “Thus says the Lord, the God of Israel, to you, Baruch
    3: You have said: ‘Woe to me, a wretched man! For the Lord has added sorrow to my sorrow. I have labored in my groaning, and I have not found rest.
    4: Thus says the Lord: So shall you say to him: Behold, those whom I have built up, I destroy, and those whom I have planted, I uproot, even this entire land
    5: And are you seeking great things for yourself? Do not choose to seek them. For behold, I will lead evil over all that is flesh, says the Lord. But I will give your life to you unto salvation, in every place, wherever you may travel.

  Chapter 46.

    1: The word of the Lord that came to Jeremiah the prophet against the Gentiles
    2: about Egypt, against the army of Pharaoh Neco, the king of Egypt, which was beside the river Euphrates at Carchemish, which Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, struck down, in the fourth year of Jehoiakim, the son of Josiah, the king of Judah
    3: “ ‘Prepare the heavy and the light shield, and advance to war
    4: Harness the horses, and let the horsemen climb upon them! Stand forth with helmets! Sharpen the lances! Clothe yourselves in armor!
    5: And what is next? I have seen them terrified, and turning their backs, their strong ones cut down. They have fled in disorder and have not looked back. Terror on every side, says the Lord
    6: Let not the swift take flight; let not the strong ones think to save themselves. They have been conquered and ruined, toward the north, near the river Euphrates
    7: Who is this, who ascends like a flood, and whose streams swell up, like those of the rivers
    8: Egypt ascends in the form of a river, and its waves will be moved like those of a river. And he will say: ‘I will ascend and cover the earth! I will perish the city and its inhabitants!
    9: Mount the horses, and exult upon chariots, and let the strong ones advance: the Ethiopians, and the Libyans, who hold the heavy shield, and the Lydians, who grasp and shoot arrows
    10: For this is the day of the Lord, the God of hosts, a day of vengeance, so that he may vindicate himself of his enemies. The sword will devour, and be satiated, and be inebriated with their blood. For there is a victim of the Lord, the God of hosts, in the land of the north, beside the river Euphrates
    11: Ascend to Gilead, and take its balm, O virgin daughter of Egypt! It is in vain that you multiply medicines; there will be no health for you
    12: The nations have heard of your disgrace, and your wailing has filled the earth. For the strong have stumbled against the strong, and both have fallen together.
    13: The word that the Lord spoke to Jeremiah the prophet, concerning how Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, would arrive and strike the land of Egypt
    14: “Announce it to Egypt, and make it heard in Migdol, and let it resonate in Memphis and in Tahpanhes. Say this: Stand and prepare yourself! For the sword will devour everything around you
    15: Why have your strong ones decayed? They have not stood firm, because the Lord has overthrown them
    16: He has multiplied those in ruin, and each man has fallen beside his neighbor. And they will say: ‘Rise up, and let us return to our own people and to the land of our nativity, away from the face of the sword of the dove
    17: Call the name of Pharaoh, the king of Egypt: ‘Time has brought tumult.
    18: As I live, says the King, whose name is the Lord of hosts, just as Tabor is among the mountains, and just as Carmel is beside the sea, so will he come
    19: Equip yourself for the transmigration, O daughter who inhabits Egypt. For Memphis will be in desolation, and it will be deserted and uninhabited
    20: Egypt is like a stately and finely-formed calf. The one who will goad her will come from the north
    21: Her hired hands also, who move within her midst, like fatted calves have been turned back, and they have fled at the same time, and they are not able to stand firm. For the day of their passing away has overwhelmed them; it is the time of their visitation
    22: Her voice will sound out like brass. For they will rush forward with an army, and with axes they will come against her, like those who chop wood
    23: They have cut down her forest, says the Lord, which was not able to be counted. They have been multiplied more than locusts, and they are without number
    24: The daughter of Egypt has been confounded, and she has been delivered into the hand of the people of the north
    25: The Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, said: Behold, I will visit against the tumult of Alexandria, and against Pharaoh, and against Egypt, and against her gods, and against her kings, and against Pharaoh, and against those who trust in him
    26: And I will give them over to the hand of those who seek their lives, and into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, and into the hand of his servants. And after this, it shall be inhabited, just as in the former days, says the Lord
    27: And as for you, my servant Jacob, you should not be afraid, and you should not dread, O Israel. For behold, I will bring your salvation from afar, and your offspring from the land of your captivity. And Jacob will return and have rest, and he will prosper. And there will be no one who may terrify him
    28: And as for you, my servant Jacob, do not be afraid, says the Lord. For I am with you. For I will consume all the nations to which I have cast you out. Yet truly, I will not consume you. Instead, I will chastise you in judgment, but neither will I spare you, as if you were innocent.

  Chapter 47.

    1: The word of the Lord that came to Jeremiah, the prophet, against the Philistines, before Pharaoh struck Gaza
    2: Thus says the Lord: “Behold, waters will rise up from the north, and they will be like an inundating torrent, and they will cover the land and its plenitude, the city and its inhabitants. The men will cry out, and all the inhabitants of the land will wail
    3: before the uproar of a procession of weapons and of his soldiers, before the commotion of his four-horse chariots and the multitude of his wheels. The fathers have not looked back for the sons, because of feebleness of hands
    4: because of the arrival of the day on which all the Philistines will be devastated, and Tyre and Sidon will be destroyed, with all the rest of their helpers. For the Lord has depopulated the Philistines, the remnant of the island of Cappadocia
    5: Baldness has arrived over Gaza. Ashkelon has been silenced, along with the remnant of their valley. And how long will you continue to be cut down
    6: O sharp sword of the Lord, how long will you be without rest? Enter your sheath; be refreshed and silenced
    7: But how can it find rest, when the Lord has ordered it against Ashkelon and against its maritime regions, and when a task has been appointed to it there?

  Chapter 48.

    1: Against Moab, thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: “Woe upon Nebo! For it has been devastated and confounded. Kiriathaim has been seized; the strong one has been confounded and has trembled
    2: There is no longer any rejoicing in Moab over Heshbon. They have devised evil. ‘Come and let us destroy it as a nation.’ Then you will be utterly silenced, and the sword will pursue you
    3: A voice of clamor from Horonaim: devastation and great destruction
    4: Moab has been crushed. Announce an outcry for her little ones
    5: For, along the ascent of Luhith, the mourner will ascend with weeping. For, on the descent of Horonaim, the enemies have heard the wailing of devastation
    6: Flee, save your lives! And you shall be like a saltcedar tree in the desert
    7: For because you have had faith in your fortifications and in your storehouses, you too will be seized. And Chemosh will go into captivity: his priests and his leaders together
    8: And the despoiler will overwhelm every city, and not a single city will be saved. And the valleys will perish, and the fields will be destroyed. For the Lord has spoken
    9: Give a blossom to Moab. For it will depart when it is blossoming. And its cities will become desolate and uninhabited
    10: Cursed is he who does the work of the Lord deceitfully. And cursed is he who prohibits his sword from blood
    11: Moab has been fertile from his youth, and he has rested amid his brood. And he has not been transferred from vessel to vessel, nor has he gone into the transmigration. Therefore, his taste has remained with him, and his scent has not changed
    12: Because of this, behold, the days are approaching, says the Lord, when I will send to him those who will line up and knock down his bottles, and they will knock him down and empty his vessels, and they will break their bottles against one another
    13: And Moab will be confounded by Chemosh, just as the house of Israel was shamed by Bethel, in which they had faith
    14: How can you say: ‘We are strong and robust men of battle?
    15: Moab has been devastated, and they have cut down her cities. And her elect young men have descended to slaughter. So says the King, whose name is the Lord of hosts
    16: The passing away of Moab draws near and arrives. Its evil will rush forward with great speed
    17: Console him, all you who surround him and all you who know his name. Say: ‘How has the strong staff become broken, the glorious staff?
    18: Descend from your glory, and sit in thirst, O habitation of the daughter of Dibon! For the destroyer of Moab has ascended to you; he has dissipated your fortifications
    19: Stand in the way, and gaze out, O habitation of Aroer! Question him who is fleeing, and say to him who has escaped: ‘What has happened?
    20: Moab has been confounded, because he has been conquered. Wail and cry out! Announce it in Arnon: Moab has been devastated
    21: and judgment has arrived upon the land of the plains: upon Holon, and upon Jahzah, and upon Mephaath
    22: and upon Dibon, and upon Nebo, and upon the house of Deblathaim
    23: and upon Kiriathaim, and upon the house of Gamul, and upon the house of Meon
    24: and upon Kerioth, and upon Bozrah, and upon all the cities of the land of Moab, those far away and those nearby
    25: The horn of Moab has been cut away, and his arm has been crushed, says the Lord
    26: Inebriate him, for he has lifted himself up against the Lord. And Moab will thrust his hand into his own vomit, and also now he himself will become a derision
    27: For Israel had been a derision to them. It was as if you had discovered him among thieves. Because of your own words, then, which you have spoken against him, you will be led away captive
    28: Relinquish the cities, and live upon a rock, O inhabitants of Moab, and be like a dove nesting at the mouth of an opening at the summit
    29: We have listened to the arrogance of Moab; he is very proud: his exaltation, and arrogance, and pride, and the loftiness of his heart
    30: I myself know, says the Lord, his boasting, and that his ability is not in accord with it, nor is it in accord with what he has been striving to do
    31: For this reason, I will wail over Moab, and I will cry out to all of Moab, to the men on the brick wall who are lamenting
    32: O vineyard of Sibmah, I will weep for you, with the mourning of Jazer. Your offshoots have crossed over the sea. They have reached even to the sea of Jazer. The despoiler has rushed over your harvest and your vintage
    33: Rejoicing and exultation has been taken away from Carmel and from the land of Moab. And I have taken the wine from the winepresses. The treader of grapes will no longer sing the usual rhythmic chant
    34: From the outcry of Heshbon, even to Elealeh and Jahzah, they have uttered their voice; from Zoar, even to Horonaim, like a three year old calf. So too, the waters of Nimrim will be very bad
    35: And I will take away from Moab, says the Lord, the one who makes offerings in exalted places, and the one who sacrifices to his gods
    36: Because of this, my heart will resound for Moab, like the pipes, and my heart will make a sound like the pipes for the men on the brick wall. For he has done more than he was able, yet still they have perished
    37: For every head will be bald, and every beard will be shaved. All the hands will be bound together, and there will be haircloth on every back
    38: Over all the rooftops of Moab, and in its streets, everyone will mourn. For I have crushed Moab like a useless vessel, says the Lord
    39: How was it conquered, so that they would wail? How is it that Moab has cast down his neck and been confounded? And Moab will be a derision and an example to everyone around him.
    40: Thus says the Lord: “Behold, he will fly like the eagle, and he will extend his wings to Moab
    41: Kerioth has been captured, and the fortifications have been taken. And in that day, the heart of the strong ones of Moab will be like the heart of a woman giving birth
    42: And Moab will cease to be a people. For he has been glorified against the Lord
    43: Terror and the pit and the snare will overwhelm you, O inhabitant of Moab, says the Lord
    44: Whoever flees from the terror will fall into the pit. And whoever climbs out of the pit will be seized by the snare. For I will lead over Moab the year of their visitation, says the Lord
    45: Those fleeing from the snare stood in the shadow of Heshbon. For a fire has gone forth from Heshbon, and a flame from the midst of Sihon, and it will devour the portion of Moab, and the top of the head of the sons of tumult
    46: Woe to you, O Moab! You have been ruined, O people of Chemosh! For your sons and your daughters have been taken into captivity
    47: But I will convert the captivity of Moab in the last days, says the Lord.” Such are the judgments of Moab thus far
