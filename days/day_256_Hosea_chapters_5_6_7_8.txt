Day 256:

Reading Hosea, chapters ['5', '6', '7', '8']:

  Chapter 5.

    1: Hear this, priests, and pay attention, house of Israel, and listen closely, house of the king. For there is a judgment against you, because you have become a trap for those you watched over, and a net stretched out over Tabor
    2: And you have led astray victims into the depths, though I am the teacher of them all
    3: I know Ephraim, and Israel has not been hidden from me, yet now Ephraim has committed fornication, and Israel has been contaminated
    4: They will not set their thoughts to return to their God, for the spirit of fornication is in the midst of them, and they have not known the Lord
    5: And the arrogance of Israel will answer to his face. And Israel and Ephraim will fall in their iniquity, and even Judah will fall with them
    6: With their flocks and their herds, they will go to seek the Lord, and they will not find him. He has taken himself away from them
    7: They have sinned against the Lord. For they have conceived sons that are strangers. Now one month will devour them with all their own
    8: Sound the bugle in Gibeah, the trumpet in Ramah. Shout in Bethaven, behind your back, O Benjamin
    9: Ephraim will be in desolation on the day of correction, for within the tribes of Israel, I have revealed faith
    10: The leaders of Judah have become like those who assume the end. I will pour my wrath over them like water
    11: Ephraim has been enduring malicious slander and broken judgment, because he began to go after filth
    12: And I will be like a moth to Ephraim, and like decay to the house of Judah
    13: And Ephraim saw his own weakness, and Judah his chains. And Ephraim went to Assur, and he sent to the Avenging king. But he will not be able to heal you, nor is he able to release you from your chains
    14: For I will be like a lioness to Ephraim, and like a lion’s offspring to the house of Judah. I myself will seize and go forth. I will take away, and there is no one who can rescue
    15: I will go and return to my place, until you shall grow faint and seek my face

  Chapter 6.

    1: In their tribulation, they will arise early to me. Come, let us return to the Lord
    2: For he has seized us, and he will heal us. He will strike, and he will cure us
    3: He will revive us after two days; on the third day he will raise us up, and we will live in his sight. We will understand, and we will continue on, so that we may know the Lord. His landing place has been prepared like the first light of morning, and he will come to us like the early and the late rains of the land
    4: What am I to do with you, Ephraim? What am I to do with you, Judah? Your mercy is like the morning mist, and like the dew passing away in the morning
    5: Because of this, I have cut them with the prophets, I have slain them with the words of my mouth; and your opinions will depart like the light
    6: For I desired mercy and not sacrifice, and knowledge of God more than holocausts
    7: But they, like Adam, have transgressed the covenant; in this, they have been dishonest with me
    8: Gilead is a city that manufactures idols; it has been tripped up by family relations
    9: And, like those who rob with skillful words, they, by conspiring with the priests, bring a death sentence to travelers on a pilgrimage from Shechem; for they have been performing evil deeds
    10: I have seen horrible things in the house of Israel; the fornications of Ephraim are there. Israel has been contaminated
    11: But you, Judah, set a harvest for yourself, while I reverse the captivity of my people

  Chapter 7.

    1: When I was willing to heal Israel, the iniquity of Ephraim was discovered, and the malice of Samaria, for they had been manufacturing lies. And the thief steals from inside, the robber from outside
    2: And, so that they may not say in their hearts that I am the one who has called to mind all of their wickedness: now their own inventions have encircled them. These things have happened in my presence
    3: The king has rejoiced at their wickedness, and the leaders have rejoiced in their lies
    4: They are all adulterers; like an oven heating up before baking, the city rested a little before the leaven was mixed in, until the whole was leavened
    5: On the day of our king, the leaders began to be mad with wine; he extended his hand with those who fabricate illusions
    6: For they have used their heart like an oven, while he laid snares for them; he slept through the night baking them, and by morning he himself was heated like a burning fire
    7: They have all become hot like an oven, and they have devoured their judges. All their kings have fallen. There is no one who calls to me among them
    8: Ephraim himself has been mingled with the nations. Ephraim has become like bread, baked under ashes, that has not been turned over
    9: Strangers have devoured his strength, and he did not know it. And grey hairs also have spread across him, and he is ignorant of it
    10: And the pride of Israel will be brought low before his face, for they have not returned to the Lord their God, nor have they sought him in all of this
    11: And Ephraim has become like a pigeon that has been led astray, not having a heart; for they called upon Egypt, they went to the Assyrians
    12: And when they will set out, I will spread my net over them. I will pull them down like the birds of the sky; I will cut them down in accordance with the reports of their meetings
    13: Woe to them, for they have withdrawn from me. They will waste away because they have been dishonest with me. And I redeemed them, and they have spoken lies against me
    14: And they have not cried out to me in their heart, but they howled on their beds. They have obsessed about wheat and wine; they have withdrawn from me
    15: And I have educated them, and I have reinforced their arms; and they have imagined evil against me
    16: They returned so that they might be without a yoke. They have become like a deceitful bow. Their leaders will fall by the sword because of the madness of their words. This is their derision in the land of Egypt

  Chapter 8.

    1: Let there be a trumpet in your throat, like an eagle over the house of the Lord, on behalf of those who have transgressed my covenant and violated my law
    2: They will call on me: “O my God, we, Israel, know you.
    3: Israel has thrown away goodness; the enemy will overtake him
    4: They have reigned, but not by me. Leaders have emerged, and I did not recognize them. Their silver and their gold, they have made into idols for themselves, so that they might cross over
    5: Your calf, Samaria, has been rejected. My fury has been enraged against them. How long will they be incapable of being cleansed
    6: For it is itself also from Israel: a workman made it, and it is not God. For the calf of Samaria will be used for the webs of spiders
    7: For they will sow wind and reap a whirlwind. It does not have a firm stalk; the bud will yield no grain. But if it does yield, strangers will eat it
    8: Israel has been devoured. Now, among the nations, it has become like an unclean vessel
    9: For they have gone up to Assur, a wild ass alone by himself. Ephraim has given presents to his lovers
    10: But even when they will have brought the nations together for the sake of money, now I will assemble them. And they will rest for a little while from the burden of the king and the leaders
    11: For Ephraim multiplied altars to sin, and sanctuaries have become an offense for him
    12: I will write to him my intricate laws, which have been treated like strangers
    13: They will offer victims, they will immolate flesh and will eat, and the Lord will not accept them. For now he will remember their iniquity, and he will repay their sins: they will be turned back to Egypt
    14: And Israel has forgotten his Maker and has built shrines. And Judah has increased its fortified cities. And I will send fire upon his cities, and it will devour its structures
