    1: A Prayer of David himself. Incline your ear, O Lord, and hear me. For I am needy and poor
    2: Preserve my soul, for I am holy. My God, bring salvation to your servant who hopes in you
    3: O Lord, be merciful to me, for I have cried out to you all day long
    4: Give joy to the soul of your servant, for I have lifted up my soul to you, Lord
    5: For you are sweet and mild, Lord, and plentiful in mercy to all who call upon you
    6: Pay attention, Lord, to my prayer, and attend to the voice of my supplication
    7: In the day of my tribulation, I cried out to you, because you heeded me
    8: There is no one like you among the gods, O Lord, and there is no one like you in your works
    9: All the nations, which you have made, will draw near and adore in your presence, O Lord. And they will glorify your name
    10: For you are great, and you perform wonders. You alone are God
    11: Lead me, O Lord, in your way, and I will walk in your truth. May my heart rejoice, so that it will fear your name
    12: I will confess to you, O Lord my God, with my whole heart. And I will glorify your name in eternity
    13: For your mercy toward me is great, and you have rescued my soul from the lower part of Hell
    14: O God, the iniquitous have risen up against me, and the synagogue of the powerful have sought my soul, and they have not placed you in their sight
    15: And you, Lord God, are compassionate and merciful, being patient and full of mercy and truthful
    16: Look down upon me and have mercy on me. Grant your authority to your servant, and bring salvation to the son of your handmaid

  Chapter 86.

    1: A Canticle Psalm to the sons of Korah. Its foundations are in the holy mountains
    2: the Lord loves the gates of Zion above all the tabernacles of Jacob
    3: Glorious things are being said of you, O City of God
    4: I will be mindful of Rahab and of Babylon knowing me. Behold, the foreigners, and Tyre, and the people of the Ethiopians: these have been there
    5: Will not Zion say that this man and that man were born in her? And the Most High himself has founded her
    6: The Lord will explain, in the writings of peoples and of leaders, about those who have been in her
    7: For so the dwelling place within you is with all rejoicing

  Chapter 87.

    1: A Canticle Psalm to the sons of Korah. Unto the end. For Mahalath, to answer the understanding of Heman the Ezrahite
    2: O Lord, God of my salvation: I have cried out, day and night, in your presence
    3: Let my prayer enter in your sight. Incline your ear to my petition
    4: For my soul has been filled with evils, and my life has drawn near to Hell
    5: I am considered to be among those who will descend into the pit. I have become like a man without assistance
    6: idle among the dead. I am like the wounded sleeping in sepulchers, whom you no longer remember, and who have been repelled by your hand
    7: They have lain me in the lower pit: in dark places and in the shadow of death
    8: Your fury has been confirmed over me. And you have brought all your waves upon me
    9: You have sent my acquaintances far from me. They have set me as an abomination to themselves. I was handed over, yet I did not depart
    10: My eyes languished before destitution. All day long, I cried out to you, O Lord. I stretched out my hands to you
    11: Will you perform wonders for the dead? Or will physicians raise to life, and so confess to you
    12: Could anyone declare your mercy in the sepulcher, or your truth from within perdition
    13: Will your wonders be known in the darkness, or your justice in the land of oblivion
    14: And I have cried out to you, O Lord, and in early morning, my prayer will come before you
    15: Lord, why do you reject my prayer? Why do you turn your face away from me
    16: I am poor, and I have been amid hardships from my youth. And, though I have been exalted, I am humbled and disturbed
    17: Your wrath has crossed into me, and your terrors have disturbed me
    18: They have surrounded me like water, all day long. They have surrounded me, all at once
    19: Friend and neighbor, and my acquaintances, you have sent far away from me, away from misery

    31: But if his sons abandon my law, and if they do not walk in my judgments
    32: if they profane my justices, and if they do not keep my commandments
    33: I will visit their iniquities with a rod, and their sins with a beating
    34: But I will not scatter my mercy from him, and I will not do harm to my truth

    39: Yet, truly, you have rejected and despised, you have pushed away, my Christ
    40: You have overthrown the covenant of your servant. You have profaned his sanctuary on earth

    46: You have reduced the days of his time. You have flooded him with confusion
    47: How long, O Lord? Will you turn away unto the end? Will your wrath flare up like a fire
