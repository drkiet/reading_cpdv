    1: Let us praise the men of glory, and our ancestors in their generation
    2: The Lord has wrought great glory, by his own magnificence, from ancient times
    3: There are those who rule with their authority, men of great virtue, who are gifted with prudence. There are those who announce among the prophets, with the dignity of prophets
    4: And there are those who rule over the present generation, by the virtue of prudence, with very holy words for the people
    5: There are those who, by their skill, compose musical themes, so as to set the verses of Scripture to music
    6: There are men rich in virtue, who make a study of beauty, who live in peacefulness in their houses
    7: All these obtained glory in their generations, and they had praise in their days
    8: They left behind a name for those who were born of them, so that their praises might be described
    9: But for some of them, there is no memorial. They have passed away as if they had never existed; and they have become as if they had never been born, and their sons along with them
    10: But these were men of mercy, whose pious deeds have not failed
    11: Good things continue with their offspring
    12: Their descendents are a holy inheritance, and their offspring stand firm in the covenants

    15: Let the people declare their wisdom, and let the Church announce their praise
    16: Enoch pleased God, and he was transferred to Paradise, so that he might offer repentance to the nations

    19: The covenants of the world were placed with him, so that all flesh would not be wiped away by the great flood
    20: Abraham was the great father of a multitude of nations, and no one was found to be like him in glory. He observed the law of the Most High, and he formed a covenant with him
    21: In his flesh, he caused the covenant to stand, and when tested, he was found to be faithful
    22: Therefore, by an oath, he gave glory to him among his people, so as to increase him like the dust of the earth
    23: and to exalt his offspring like the stars, and to give an inheritance to them from sea to sea, and from the river even to the ends of the earth
    24: And he acted in like manner toward Isaac, because of his father Abraham

    27: And he preserved for him men of mercy, who were found to have grace before the eyes of all flesh

    10: He placed upon him a garment to the feet, and pants, and an ephod, and he wrapped him all around with many little bells of gold
    11: so that there would be a sound at his arrival, and so as to make a noise that would be heard in the temple, as a memorial for the sons of his people
    12: He provided him with a holy robe of gold and hyacinth and purple, a woven work for a wise man of judgment and truth
    13: a work of twisted scarlet, the work of an artist, with precious stones, cut and set in gold, and engraved by the work of a jeweler, as a memorial according to the number of the tribes of Israel
    14: He provided him with a crown of gold upon his headdress, on which was written a symbol of holiness, a mark of honor. This was a work of virtue and a delight to the eyes in its beauty

    21: And he gave him authority by his precepts, in the covenants of his judgments, to teach Jacob his testimonies, and to give light by his law to Israel
    22: Then strangers stood up against him, and, because of envy, the men who were with Dathan and Abiram surrounded him in the desert, along with the congregation of Korah, in their anger

    24: He wrought great portents among them, and he consumed them with a flame of fire
    25: And he added glory to Aaron, and he gave him an inheritance, and he allotted to him the first-fruits of the earth
    26: He prepared for them the finest bread unto fullness. And they shall also eat from the sacrifices of the Lord, which he gave to him and to his offspring
    27: And yet he will not have an inheritance among the people of the land, and he has no portion among the people. For the Lord himself is his portion and his inheritance
    28: Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, is third in glory, by imitating him in the fear of the Lord

  Chapter 46.

    1: Joshua, the son of Nun, was valiant in warfare; he was the successor of Moses among the prophets. He was great in accord with his name
    2: very great in the saving the elect of God. He fought against the insurgent enemies, so that he might obtain the inheritance for Israel
    3: What great glory he secured, by lifting up his hands and throwing his spears against the cities
    4: Who before him has stood so firmly? For the Lord himself led forward the enemies
    5: Was not the sun halted by his wrath, and one day made as if two
    6: He called upon the Most High Power, when the enemies assailed him on every side. And the great and holy God answered him with hailstones of exceedingly great force
    7: He made a violent assault against a hostile nation, and at his descent, he destroyed his adversaries
    8: so that the nations would acknowledge his power: that it is not easy to fight against God. And he followed the Almighty
    9: And in the days of Moses, he accomplished a work of mercy. He and Caleb, the son of Jephuneh, stood against the enemy, and forbid the people from sin, and broke their wicked murmuring
    10: And these two, having been appointed, were freed from peril, from foot soldiers numbering six hundred thousand, so as to lead them into their inheritance, into a land flowing with milk and honey
    11: And the Lord gave strength to Caleb also, and his strength remained even in his old age, so that he ascended to the high places of the land, and his offspring obtained it as an inheritance
    12: This was so that all the sons of Israel would see that it is good to obey the holy God
    13: Then there were the judges, each one called by name, whose heart was not corrupted. They did not turn away from the Lord

    15: and their name might remain forever, continuing in their sons, holy men of glory
    16: Samuel, prophet of the Lord, beloved by the Lord his God, established a new government, and he anointed leaders over his people
    17: By the law of the Lord, he judged the congregation, and the God of Jacob saw it, and so, by his fidelity, he was proven to be a prophet
    18: And he was known to be faithful in his words. For he saw the God of light
    19: And when fighting against the enemies, who stood against him on every side, he called upon the name of the Almighty Lord, with an offering of an inviolate lamb
    20: And the Lord thundered from heaven, and with a great noise, he made his voice to be heard
    21: And he crushed the leaders of the Tyrians, and all the commanders of the Philistines
    22: And before the time of the end of his life in the world, he offered testimony in the sight of the Lord and of his Christ, that he had not taken a bribe from any flesh, not even so much as a shoe, and that no man made an accusation against him
    23: And after this, he slept. And he made known to the king and revealed to him the end of his life. And he lifted up his voice from the earth in prophecy, to abolish the impiety of the people

  Chapter 47.

    1: After these things, Nathan the prophet arose, in the days of David
    2: And just as fat is separated from meat, so was David separated from the sons of Israel

    4: Did he not kill the giant, and take away the reproach from his people
    5: By lifting up his hand, with a stone in a sling, he threw down the boasting of Goliath
    6: For he called upon the Almighty Lord, and he swore with his right hand to take away the mighty man of war, and to exalt the horn of his people
    7: So he glorified him amid ten thousand, and he praised him with the blessings of the Lord, by offering him a crown of glory

    9: In all his works, he gave thanks to the Holy One, to the Most High, with words of glory
    10: With all his heart, he praised the Lord and he loved God, who made him and who gave him power against his enemies
    11: And he appointed singers to stand opposite the altar, and by their voices he provided sweet music
    12: And he provided beauty for the celebrations, and he gave order to the times, even until the end of his life, so that they would praise the holy name of the Lord, and magnify the sanctity of God, from early morning
    13: The Lord purged his sins, and he exalted his horn forever. And he gave him the covenant of the kingdom, and a throne of glory in Israel
    14: After him, an understanding son rose up. And by means of him, he cast down all the power of the enemies
    15: Solomon reigned in days of peace, and God subjected all his enemies to him, so that he might build a house in his name, and prepare a sanctuary for all time. O how well-taught you were in your youth
    16: And you were filled with wisdom like a river, and your mind exposed the world
    17: And you explained mysteries by means of parables. Your name became known to far off islands, and you were beloved for your peace
    18: The earth was in wonder over your canticles, and proverbs, and parables, and interpretations
    19: and over the name of the Lord God, who is known as the God of Israel
    20: You gathered gold like copper, and you multiplied silver like lead
    21: But you bent your thigh to women, and you were held by the power of your body
    22: You brought a stain upon your glory, and you profaned your seed, so as to bring wrath upon your children, and to incite your foolishness
    23: so that you would cause the kingdom to be divided, and an obstinate kingdom to rule from Ephraim
    24: But God will not abandon his mercy, nor will he corrupt or abolish his own works. And he will not perish the stock of the descendents of his elect. And he will not destroy the offspring of him who loves the Lord
    25: Therefore, he left behind a remnant for Jacob and for David, from the same stock
    26: And Solomon had his end with his fathers
    27: And he left behind himself some of his offspring, as the folly of the nation
    28: both Rehoboam, who had little prudence,  and who turned away the people by his counsel
    29: and Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, who caused Israel to sin, and who provided a way of sin to Ephraim. And their sins were multiplied exceedingly
    30: They thoroughly turned them away from their own land
    31: And they sought every kind of wickedness, even until punishment overwhelmed them, and freed them from every kind of sin
