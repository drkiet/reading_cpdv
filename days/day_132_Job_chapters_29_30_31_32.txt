Day 132:

Reading Job, chapters ['29', '30', '31', '32']:

  Chapter 29.

    1: Job also added to this, using figures of speech, and he said
    2: Who will grant to me that I might be as I was in former months, according to the days when God kept watch over me
    3: At that time, his lamp shined over my head, and by his light, I walked through the darkness
    4: I was then just as in the days of my youth, when God was privately in my tabernacle
    5: At that time, the Almighty was with me and my children surrounded me
    6: Then, I washed my feet with butter, and a boulder poured out rivers of oil for me
    7: When I went to the gate of the city, or to the main street, they prepared a chair for me
    8: The youths saw me and hid themselves, and the elders, rising up, remained standing
    9: The leaders stopped talking, and they placed a finder over their mouth
    10: The commanders subdued their voice, and their tongue adhered to their throat
    11: The ear that heard me, blessed me, and the eye that saw me, gave testimony for me
    12: This was because I had freed the poor, who cried out, and the orphan, who had no helper
    13: The blessing of him who would have been destroyed came upon me, and I consoled the heart of the widow
    14: I put on justice, and I clothed myself with my judgment, like a robe and a diadem
    15: I was an eye for the blind and a foot for the lame
    16: I was the father of the poor; and if I lacked knowledge about any case, I investigated very diligently
    17: I crushed the jaws of the impious, and I took away prey from his teeth
    18: And I said, “I will die in my little nest, and like a palm tree, I will multiply my days
    19: My root has been spread beside the waters, and the dew will remain with my harvest
    20: My glory will always be restored, and my bow will be restored to my hand.
    21: Those who heard me, expected vindication, and they listened closely in silence to my counsel
    22: To my words, they dared to add nothing, and my eloquence poured over them
    23: They waited for me as for rain, and they opened their mouth as for belated rains
    24: If I had ever laughed at them, they would not have believed it, and the light of my face was not cast down towards the ground
    25: If I wished to go to them, I sat down first, and, though I sat like a king surrounded by an army, yet I was a comforter to those who mourned

  Chapter 30.

    1: But now, those younger in years scorn me, whose fathers I would not have seen fit to place with the dogs of my flock
    2: the strength of whose hands was nothing to me, and they were considered unworthy of life itself
    3: They were barren from poverty and hunger; they gnawed in solitude, layered with misfortune and misery
    4: And they chewed grass and the bark from trees, and the root of junipers was their food
    5: They took these things from the steep valleys, and when they discovered one of these things, they rushed to the others with a cry
    6: They lived in the parched desert and in caves underground or above the rocks
    7: They rejoiced among these kinds of things, and they considered it delightful to be under thorns
    8: These are the sons of foolish and base men, not even paying any attention to the land
    9: Now I become their song, and I have been made into their proverb
    10: They loathe me, and so they flee far from me, and they are not reluctant to spit in my face
    11: For he has opened his quiver and has afflicted me, and he has placed a bridle in my mouth
    12: Immediately, upon rising, my calamities rise up to the right. They have overturned my feet and have pressed me down along their way like waves
    13: They have diverted my journeys; they have waited to ambush me, and they have prevailed, and there was no one who might bring help
    14: They have rushed upon me, as when a wall is broken or a gate opened, and they have been pulled down into my miseries
    15: I have been reduced to nothing. You have taken away my desire like a wind, and my health has passed by like a cloud
    16: But now my soul withers within myself, and the days of affliction take hold of me
    17: At night, my bone is pierced with sorrows, and those who feed on me, do not sleep
    18: By the sheer number of them my clothing is worn away, and they have closed in on me like the collar of my coat
    19: I have been treated like dirt, and I have been turned into embers and ashes
    20: I cry to you, and you do not heed me. I stand up, and you do not look back at me
    21: You have changed me into hardness, and, with the hardness of your hand, you oppose me
    22: You have lifted me up, and, placing me as if on the wind, you have thrown me down powerfully
    23: I know that you will hand me over to death, where a home has been established for all the living
    24: Truly, then, you do not extend your hand in order to consume them, and if they fall down, you will save them
    25: Once, I wept over him who was afflicted, and my soul had compassion on the poor
    26: I expected good things, but evil things have come to me. I stood ready for light, yet darkness burst forth
    27: My insides have seethed, without any rest, for the days of affliction have prevented it
    28: I went forth mourning, without anger, and rising up, I cried out in confusion
    29: I was the brother of snakes, and the companion of ostriches
    30: My skin has become blackened over me, and my bones have dried up because of the heat
    31: My harp has been turned into mourning, and my pipes have been turned into a voice of weeping

  Chapter 31.

    1: I reached an agreement with my eyes, that I would not so much as think about a virgin
    2: For what portion should God from above hold for me, and what inheritance should the Almighty from on high keep
    3: Is not destruction held for the wicked and repudiation kept for those who work injustice
    4: Does he not examine my ways and number all my steps
    5: If I have walked in vanity, or if my foot has hurried towards deceitfulness
    6: let him weigh me in a just balance, and let God know my simplicity
    7: If my steps have turned aside from the way, or if my heart has followed my eyes, or if a blemish has clung to my hands
    8: then may I sow, and let another consume, and let my offspring be eradicated
    9: If my heart has been deceived over a woman, or if I have waited in ambush at my friend’s door
    10: then let my wife be the harlot of another, and let other men lean over her
    11: For this is a crime and a very great injustice
    12: It is a fire devouring all the way to perdition, and it roots out all that springs forth
    13: If I have despised being subject to judgment with my servant or my maid, when they had any complaint against me
    14: then what will I do when God rises to judge, and, when he inquires, how will I respond to him
    15: Is not he who created me in the womb, also he who labored to make him? And did not one and the same form me in the womb
    16: If I have denied the poor what they wanted and have made the eyes of the widow wait
    17: if I have eaten my morsel of food alone, while orphans have not eaten from it
    18: (for from my infancy mercy grew with me, and it came out with me from my mother’s womb;
    19: if I have looked down on him who was perishing because he had no clothing and the poor without any covering
    20: if his sides have not blessed me, and if he were not warmed with the fleece of my sheep
    21: if I have lifted up my hand over an orphan, even when it might seem to me that I have the advantage over him at the gate
    22: then may my shoulder fall from its joint, and may my arm, with all its bones, be broken
    23: For I have always feared God, like waves flowing over me, whose weight I was unable to bear
    24: If I have considered gold to be my strength, or if I have called purified gold ‘my Trust;
    25: if I have rejoiced over my great success, and over the many things my hand has obtained
    26: if I gazed upon the sun when it shined and the moon advancing brightly
    27: so that my heart rejoiced in secret and I kissed my hand with my mouth
    28: which is a very great iniquity and a denial against the most high God
    29: if I have been glad at the ruin of him who hated me and have exulted that evil found him
    30: for I have not been given my throat to sin by asking for a curse on his soul
    31: if the men around my tabernacle have not said: “He might give us some of his food, so that we will be filled,
    32: for the foreigner did not remain at the door, my door was open to the traveler
    33: if, as man does, I have hidden my sin and have concealed my iniquity in my bosom
    34: if I became frightened by an excessive crowd, and the disrespect of close relatives alarmed me, so that I would much rather have remained silent or have gone out the door
    35: then, would he grant me a hearing, so that the Almighty would listen to my desire, and he who judges would himself write a book
    36: which I would then carry on my shoulder and wrap around me like a crown
    37: With each of my steps, I would pronounce and offer it, as if to a prince
    38: So, if my land cries out against me, and if its furrows weep with it
    39: if I have used its fruits for nothing but money and have afflicted the souls of its tillers
    40: then, may thistles spring forth for me instead of grain, and thorns instead of barley. (This ended the words of Job.

  Chapter 32.

    1: But these three men ceased to answer Job, because he considered himself justified
    2: And Eliu the son of Barachel the Buzite, of the kindred of Ram, was angry and indignant. But he was angry against Job because he described himself to be just in the presence of God
    3: Moreover, he was indignant with his friends because they had not found a reasonable response, except in so far as they condemned Job
    4: Therefore, Eliu waited while Job was talking, for these were his elders that were speaking
    5: But when he saw that these three were not able to respond, he was extremely angry
    6: And so Eliu the son of Barachel the Buzite responded by saying: I am younger in years, and you are more ancient; therefore, I kept my head low, for I was afraid to reveal to you my opinion
    7: For I had hoped that greater age would speak, and that a multitude of years would teach wisdom
    8: But I see now that there is only breath in men, and that it is the inspiration of the Almighty that gives understanding
    9: The wise are not the aged, nor do the elders understand judgment
    10: Therefore, I will speak. Listen to me, and so I will show you my wisdom
    11: For I have endured your words; I have paid attention to your deliberations, while you were being argumentative with words
    12: And as long as I supposed that you were saying something, I considered; but now I see that there is none of you that is able to argue with Job and to respond to his words
    13: So that you will not say, “We have found wisdom,” God has thrown him down, not man
    14: He has said nothing to me, and I will not respond to him according to your words
    15: Then they were filled with dread, and so they no longer responded, and they withdrew from their  speechmaking
    16: Therefore, because I have waited and they have not been speaking, for they stood firm and did not respond at all
    17: I also will answer in my turn, and I will reveal my knowledge
    18: For I am full of words, and the feeling in my gut inspires me
    19: Yes, my stomach is like fermenting wine without a vent, which bursts the new containers
    20: I should speak, but I will also breathe a little; I will open my lips, and I will answer
    21: I will not esteem the reputation of a man, and I will not equate God with man
    22: For I do not know how long I will continue, and whether, after a while, my Maker might take me away
