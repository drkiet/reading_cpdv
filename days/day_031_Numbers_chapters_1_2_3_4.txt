    4: For Nadab and Abihu died without children, when they offered, in the sight of the Lord, a strange fire, in the desert of Sinai. And so, Eleazar and Ithamar exercised the priesthood in the sight of Aaron, their father
    5: And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying
    6: “Bring forward the tribe of Levi, and cause them to stand in the sight of Aaron the priest, in order to minister to him. And let them keep watch outside

    14: And the Lord spoke to Moses in the desert of Sinai, saying
    15: “Number the sons of Levi by the houses of their fathers and their families, every male from one month and above.

    32: But the leader of the leaders of the Levites, Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest, shall be over those who watch over the care of the Sanctuary
    33: And truly, from Merari are the peoples of the Mahlites and Mushites, having been counted by their names
    34: all those of the male gender, from one month and above: six thousand two hundred
    35: Their leader is Suriel the son of Abihaiel. They shall make camp on the north side
    36: Under their care shall be the panels of the tabernacle, and the bars, and the columns with their bases, and all the things which pertain to service of this kind

    39: All the Levites, whom Moses and Aaron numbered by their families according to the precept of the Lord, of the male gender, from one month and above, were twenty-two thousand
    40: And the Lord said to Moses: “Number the firstborn of the male sex from the sons of Israel, from one month and above, and you shall take their total
    41: And you shall bring the Levites to me, in place of all the firstborn of the sons of Israel, and you shall bring their cattle to me, in place of all the firstborn of the cattle of the sons of Israel. I am the Lord.
    42: Moses took a census, just as the Lord had instructed, of the firstborn of the sons of Israel
    43: And the males by their names, from one month and above, were twenty-two thousand two hundred seventy-three
    44: And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying
    45: “Take the Levites, in place of the firstborn of the sons of Israel, and the cattle of the Levites, in place of their cattle, and so the Levites shall be mine. I am the Lord
    46: But for the price of the two hundred and seventy-three, which exceed the number of the Levites compared to the number of firstborn of the sons of Israel
    47: you shall take five shekels for each head, by the measure of the Sanctuary. A shekel has twenty obols
    48: And you shall give the money to Aaron and his sons as the price of those that are in excess.
    49: Therefore, Moses took the money for those that were in excess, and whom they had redeemed from the Levite
    50: in place of the firstborn of the sons of Israel: one thousand three hundred sixty-five shekels, according to the weight of the Sanctuary
    51: And he gave it to Aaron and his sons, according to the word by which the Lord had instructed him

  Chapter 4.

    1: And the Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying
    2: “Take a total of the sons of Kohath from the midst of the Levites, by their houses and families
    3: from thirty years and above, even to the fiftieth year, of all who enter so as to stand and minister in the tabernacle of the covenant
    4: This is the service of the sons of Kohath: the tabernacle of the covenant and the Holy of holies
    5: Aaron and his sons shall enter, when the camp is going to move, and they shall take down the veil, which hangs before the entrance, and they shall wrap the ark of the testimony in it
    6: and they shall cover it further with a veil of violet skins, and they shall extend over it a cloth made entirely of hyacinth, and they shall draw in the bars
    7: Likewise, they shall wrap the table of the presence in a cloth of hyacinth, and they shall place with it the censers and little mortars, the cups and bowls for pouring out libations; the bread shall be always on it
    8: And they shall extend over it a cloth of scarlet, which they shall further cover with a veil of violet skins, and they shall draw in the bars
    9: They shall take also a cloth of hyacinth, with which they shall cover the lampstand with the lamps, and its tongs, and the candle snuffers, and all the vessels of oil, which are necessary for the preparation of the lamps
    10: And over all this they shall place a covering of violet skins, and they shall draw in the bars
    11: And certainly they shall wrap the golden altar in a hyacinth garment, and they shall extend over it a covering of violet skins, and they shall draw in the bars
    12: All the vessels with which they minister in the Sanctuary they shall wrap in a cloth of hyacinth, and they shall extend over it a covering of violet skins, and they shall draw in the bars
    13: Moreover, they shall cleanse the altar of ashes, and they shall wrap it in a purple garment
    14: and they shall place it with all the vessels which they use in its ministry, that is, receptacles for fire, small hooks as well as forks, larger hooks and shovels. They shall cover all the vessels of the altar together with a veil of violet skins, and they shall draw in the bars
    15: And when Aaron and his sons have wrapped the Sanctuary and its vessels at the dismantling of the camp, then the sons of Kohath shall enter, so as to carry what has been wrapped. And they shall not touch the vessels of the Sanctuary, lest they die. These are the burdens of the sons of Kohath concerning the tabernacle of the covenant
    16: Over them shall be Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, to whom belongs the care of the oil to prepare the lamps, and the incense compound, and the sacrifice, which is offered continually, and the oil of unction, and whatever pertains to the service of the tabernacle, and all the vessels that are in the Sanctuary.
    17: And the Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying
    18: “Do not be willing to lose the people of Kohath from the midst of the Levites
    19: But do this for them, so that they may live, and so that they may not die by touching the Holies of holies. Aaron and his sons shall enter, and they shall assign the work of each one, and they shall determine what each one ought to carry
    20: Let no others, out of curiosity, see the things that are in the Sanctuary before they are wrapped, otherwise they shall die.
    21: And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying
    22: “Now also take a total of the sons of Gershon, by their houses and families and kinships
    23: from thirty years and above, even to fifty years. Number all those who enter and minister in the tabernacle of the covenant
    24: This is the duty of the family of the Gershonites
    25: to carry the curtains of the tabernacle, and the roof of the covenant, the other covering, and the veil over everything, and the violet tent, which hangs at the entrance of the tabernacle of the covenant
    26: the curtains of the atrium, and the veil at the entrance, which is before tabernacle. Everything that pertains to the altar, the cords, and the vessels of the ministr
    27: the sons of Gershon shall carry, under the orders of Aaron and his sons. And so shall each one know to which burden he ought to surrender
    28: This is the service of the family of the Gershonites, in the tabernacle of the covenant, and they shall be under the hand of Ithamar, the son of Aaron the priest
    29: Likewise, you shall take a census of the sons of Merari, by the families and houses of their fathers
    30: from thirty years and above, even to fifty years, of all who enter to the office of their ministry and to the service of the covenant of the testimony
    31: These are their burdens: They shall carry the panels of the tabernacle and its bars, the columns and their bases
    32: also the columns surrounding the atrium, with their bases and tent pegs and cords. They shall accept by number all the vessels and articles, and so shall they carry them
    33: This is the office of the family of the Merarites, and their ministry for the tabernacle of the covenant. And they shall be under the hand of Ithamar, the son of Aaron the priest.
    34: Therefore, Moses and Aaron, and the leaders of the assembly, took a census of the sons of Kohath, by the kinships and houses of their fathers
    35: from thirty years and above, even to the fiftieth year, of all who enter to the ministry of the tabernacle of the covenant

    46: All who were counted from the Levites, and whom, by name, Moses and Aaron, and the leaders of Israel, counted by the kinships and houses of their fathers
