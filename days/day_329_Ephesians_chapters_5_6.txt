Day 329:

Reading Ephesians, chapters ['5', '6']:

  Chapter 5.

    1: Therefore, as most beloved sons, be imitators of God
    2: And walk in love, just as Christ also loved us and delivered himself for us, as an oblation and a sacrifice to God, with a fragrance of sweetness
    3: But let not any kind of fornication, or impurity, or rapacity so much as be named among you, just as is worthy of the saints
    4: nor any indecent, or foolish, or abusive talk, for this is without purpose; but instead, give thanks
    5: For know and understand this: no one who is a fornicator, or lustful, or rapacious (for these are a kind of service to idols) holds an inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God
    6: Let no one seduce you with empty words. For because of these things, the wrath of God was sent upon the sons of unbelief
    7: Therefore, do not choose to become participants with them
    8: For you were darkness, in times past, but now you are light, in the Lord. So then, walk as sons of the light
    9: For the fruit of the light is in all goodness and justice and truth
    10: affirming what is well-pleasing to God
    11: And so, have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but instead, refute them
    12: For the things that are done by them in secret are shameful, even to mention
    13: But all things that are disputed are made manifest by the light. For all that is made manifest is light
    14: Because of this, it is said: “You who are sleeping: awaken, and rise up from the dead, and so shall the Christ enlighten you.
    15: And so, brothers, see to it that you walk cautiously, not like the foolish
    16: but like the wise: atoning for this age, because this is an evil time
    17: For this reason, do not choose to be imprudent. Instead, understand what is the will of God
    18: And do not choose to be inebriated by wine, for this is self-indulgence. Instead, be filled with the Holy Spirit
    19: speaking among yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual canticles, singing and reciting psalms to the Lord in your hearts
    20: giving thanks always for everything, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, to God the Father
    21: Be subject to one another in the fear of Christ
    22: Wives should be submissive to their husbands, as to the Lord
    23: For the husband is the head of the wife, just as Christ is the head of the Church. He is the Savior of his body
    24: Therefore, just as the Church is subject to Christ, so also should wives be subject to their husbands in all things
    25: Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ also loved the Church and handed himself over for her
    26: so that he might sanctify her, washing her clean by water and the Word of life
    27: so that he might offer her to himself as a glorious Church, not having any spot or wrinkle or any such thing, so that she would be holy and immaculate
    28: So, too, husbands should love their wives as their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself
    29: For no man has ever hated his own flesh, but instead he nourishes and cherishes it, as Christ also does to the Church
    30: For we are a part of his body, of his flesh and of his bones
    31: “For this reason, a man shall leave behind his father and mother, and he shall cling to his wife; and the two shall be as one flesh.
    32: This is a great Sacrament. And I am speaking in Christ and in the Church
    33: Yet truly, each and every one of you should love his wife as himself. And a wife should fear her husband

  Chapter 6.

    1: Children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is just
    2: Honor your father and your mother. This is the first commandment with a promise
    3: so that it may be well with you, and so that you may have a long life upon the earth
    4: And you, fathers, do not provoke your children to anger, but educate them with the discipline and correction of the Lord
    5: Servants, be obedient to your lords according to the flesh, with fear and trembling, in the simplicity of your heart, as to Christ
    6: Do not serve only when seen, as if to please men, but act as servants of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart
    7: Serve with good will, as to the Lord, and not to men
    8: For you know that whatever good each one will do, the same will he receive from the Lord, whether he is servant or free
    9: And you, lords, act similarly toward them, setting aside threats, knowing that the Lord of both you and them is in heaven. For with him there is no favoritism toward anyone
    10: Concerning the rest, brothers, be strengthened in the Lord, by the power of his virtue
    11: Be clothed in the armor of God, so that you may be able to stand against the treachery of the devil
    12: For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against principalities and powers, against the directors of this world of darkness, against the spirits of wickedness in high places
    13: Because of this, take up the armor of God, so that you may be able to withstand the evil day and remain perfect in all things
    14: Therefore, stand firm, having been girded about your waist with truth, and having been clothed with the breastplate of justice
    15: and having feet which have been shod by the preparation of the Gospel of peace
    16: In all things, take up the shield of faith, with which you may be able to extinguish all the fiery darts of the most wicked one
    17: And take up the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit (which is the Word of God)
    18: Through every kind of prayer and supplication, pray at all times in spirit, and so be vigilant with every kind of earnest supplication, for all the saints
    19: and also for me, so that words may be given to me, as I open my mouth with faith to make known the mystery of the Gospel
    20: in such a manner that I may dare to speak exactly as I ought to speak. For I act as an ambassador in chains for the Gospel
    21: Now, so that you also may know the things that concern me and what I am doing, Tychicus, a most beloved brother and a faithful minister in the Lord, will make known everything to you
    22: I have sent him to you for this very reason, so that you may know the things that concern us, and so that he may console your hearts
    23: Peace to the brothers, and charity with faith, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ
    24: May grace be with all those who love our Lord Jesus Christ, unto incorruption. Amen
