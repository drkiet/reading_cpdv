Day 347:

Reading 1-Peter, chapters ['5']:

  Chapter 5.

    1: Therefore, I beg the elders who are among you, as one who is also an elder and a witness of the Passion of Christ, who also shares in that glory which is to be revealed in the future
    2: pasture the flock of God that is among you, providing for it, not as a requirement, but willingly, in accord with God, and not for the sake of tainted profit, but freely
    3: not so as to dominate by means of the clerical state, but so as to be formed into a flock from the heart
    4: And when the Leader of pastors will have appeared, you shall secure an unfading crown of glory
    5: Similarly, young persons, be subject to the elders. And infuse all humility among one another, for God resists the arrogant, but to the humble he gives grace
    6: And so, be humbled under the powerful hand of God, so that he may exalt you in the time of visitation
    7: Cast all your cares upon him, for he takes care of you
    8: Be sober and vigilant. For your adversary, the devil, is like a roaring lion, traveling around and seeking those whom he might devour
    9: Resist him by being strong in faith, being aware that the same passions afflict those who are your brothers in the world
    10: But the God of all grace, who has called us to his eternal glory in Christ Jesus, will himself perfect, confirm, and establish us, after a brief time of suffering
    11: To him be glory and dominion forever and ever. Amen
    12: I have written briefly, through Sylvanus, whom I consider to be a faithful brother to you, begging and testifying that this is the true grace of God, in which you have been established
    13: The Church which is in Babylon, elect together with you, greets you, as does my son, Mark
    14: Greet one another with a holy kiss. Grace be to all of you who are in Christ Jesus. Amen
