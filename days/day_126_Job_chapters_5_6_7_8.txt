Day 126:

Reading Job, chapters ['5', '6', '7', '8']:

  Chapter 5.

    1: Therefore call, if there are any who will respond to you, and turn to one or another of the saints
    2: Truly, anger condemns the foolish to death, and envy kills the petty
    3: I have seen a fool with a strong root, and I have cursed his excellence without hesitation
    4: His sons will be far from prosperity and will be crushed at the gate, and there will be none who can rescue them
    5: Their harvest, the starving will eat. The armed man will rob him, and the thirsty will drink his resources
    6: Nothing on earth occurs without a reason, and sorrow does not rise from the earth
    7: Man is born to labor, and the bird to fly
    8: Therefore, because of this, I will beg the Lord, and place my eloquence before God
    9: He does great and unfathomable and miraculous things without number
    10: He gives rain over the face of the earth and irrigates all things with the waters
    11: He places the humble on high and encourages the grieving towards health
    12: He dispels the thoughts of the spiteful, lest their hands be able to complete what they had begun
    13: He catches the wise in their cleverness and dissipates the counsel of the perverse
    14: They will encounter darkness in the daytime, and they will grope at midday just as in the night
    15: Thereafter, he will act to save the needy from the sword of their mouth, and the poor from the hand of the violent
    16: And there will be hope for those in need, for iniquity will diminish its speech
    17: Blessed is the man whom God corrects; therefore, do not reject the chastisement of the Lord
    18: For he wounds and he cures; he strikes and his hands will heal
    19: He will deliver you into six tribulations, and in the seventh, evil will not touch you
    20: During famine, he will rescue you from death, and during war, from the hand of the sword
    21: You will be hidden from the scourge of the tongue, and you will not fear calamity when it arrives
    22: In desolation and in famine, you will laugh, and you will not dread the beasts of the earth
    23: For you are in harmony with the stones of the land, and the beasts of the earth will make peace with you
    24: And you will know that your home has peace, and, concerning your appearance, you will not sin
    25: Likewise, you will know that your offspring will be manifold and your progeny will be like the grass of the earth
    26: You will enter the grave with abundance, just as a crop of wheat is gathered in its time
    27: Behold, this is just as we have found it, which you have heard; walk it through your mind

  Chapter 6.

    1: But Job, responding, said
    2: I wish that my sins, for which I deserve wrath, and the calamity that I endure, were weighed out on a balance
    3: Compared to the sand of the sea, they would appear heavier, and so my words are full of sorrow
    4: For the arrows of the Lord are in me, my spirit drinks of their indignation, and the terrors of the Lord are soldiers against me
    5: Will the wild ass bray when he has grass? Or will the ox bellow when he stands before a full manger
    6: Or can one eat bland food, which is not seasoned with salt? Or can anyone taste that which, if tasted, causes death
    7: The things that my soul was unwilling to touch before, now, because of anguish, are my foods
    8: Who will grant that my petition may arrive and that God may bestow on me what I expect
    9: and that he who, at first, had crushed me, will let loose his hand and cut me down
    10: And may this be my consolation, that in afflicting me with sorrow, although he might not be lenient with me, I still do not contradict the words of the Holy One
    11: For what is my strength, that I may continue? Or what is my goal, so that I may act patiently
    12: My strength is not the strength of stones, nor is my flesh made of bronze
    13: Behold, there is no help for me in myself, and my loved ones also have withdrawn from me
    14: He who takes away mercy from his friend, abandons the fear of the Lord
    15: My brethren have disregarded me, like a torrent that passes swiftly through the steep valleys
    16: Those who fear frost, snow will rush over them
    17: At that time, when they are scattered, they will perish, and when it becomes hot, they will be freed from their place
    18: The paths of their steps are entangled; they will walk in vain and will perish
    19: Consider the paths of Thema, the ways of Saba, and wait a little while
    20: They have been thrown into confusion, just as I had hoped; they have even come to me and are overwhelmed with shame
    21: Now you have arrived, and merely by seeing my affliction, you are afraid
    22: Did I say: “Bring to me and give to me from your necessities?
    23: or, “Free me from the hand of the enemy and rescue me from the hand of the strong?
    24: Teach me, and I will be silent, and if by chance I have been ignorant of anything, instruct me
    25: Why have you diminished the words of truth, when there is none of you who is able to offer proof against me
    26: You prepare speeches as so much noise, and you offer words into the wind
    27: You encroach upon the orphan, and you strive to undermine your friend
    28: Such is true, so finish what you have begun. Listen closely, and see if I lie
    29: Respond, I beg you, without contention, and, speaking what is just, pass judgment
    30: And you will not find iniquity on my tongue, nor will foolishness resound in my throat

  Chapter 7.

    1: The life of a man on the earth is a battle, and his days are like the days of a hired hand
    2: Just as a servant desires the shade, and just as the hired hand looks forward to the end of his work
    3: so also have I had empty months and have counted my burdensome nights
    4: If I lie down to sleep, I will say, “When will I rise?” And next I will hope for the evening and will be filled with sorrows even until darkness
    5: My flesh is clothed with particles of rottenness and filth; my skin is dried up and tightened
    6: My days have passed by more quickly than threads are cut by a weaver, and they have been consumed without any hope
    7: Remember that my life is wind, and my eye will not return to see good things
    8: Neither will the sight of man gaze upon me; your eyes are upon me, and I will not endure
    9: Just as a cloud is consumed and passes away, so he who descends to hell will not ascend
    10: He will not return again to his house, nor will his own place know him any longer
    11: And because of this, I will not restrain my mouth. I will speak in the affliction of my spirit. I will converse from the bitterness of my soul
    12: Am I an ocean or a whale, that you have encircled me in a prison
    13: If I say, “My bed will comfort me, and I will find rest, speaking with myself on my blanket,
    14: then you will frighten me with dreams, and strike dread through visions
    15: so that, because of these things, my soul would choose hanging, and my bones, death
    16: I despair; by no means will I live any longer. Spare me, for my days are nothing
    17: What is man, that you should praise him? Or why do you place your heart near him
    18: You visit him at dawn, and you test him unexpectedly
    19: How long will you not spare me, nor release me to ingest my saliva
    20: I have sinned; what should I do for you, O keeper of men? Why have you set me against you, so that I have become burdensome even to myself
    21: Why do you not steal away my sin, and why do you not sweep away my iniquity? Behold, now I will sleep in the dust, and if you seek me in the morning, I will not remain

  Chapter 8.

    1: But Baldad the Suhite, responding, said
    2: How long will you speak this way, so that the words of your mouth are like a changeable wind
    3: Does God supplant judgment, or does the Almighty subvert that which is just
    4: And if now your children have sinned against him, and he has dismissed them into the power of their iniquity
    5: even so, you should arise early to God, so as to beseech the Almighty
    6: If you approach with purity and honesty, he will quickly be attentive to you, and a peaceful life will repay your righteousness
    7: so much so that, if your former things were small, your latter things would be multiplied greatly
    8: For inquire of the earliest generation, and investigate diligently the history of the fathers
    9: (of course, we are but of yesterday and are ignorant that our days on earth are like a shadow,
    10: and they will teach you; they will speak with you and will offer you the eloquence of their hearts
    11: Can the marsh plant live without moisture? Or can sedges grow without water
    12: When it is still in flower, and has not been pulled up by hand, it withers before all other plants
    13: Just so are the ways of all who forget God, and the hope of the hypocrite will perish
    14: His frenzy will not please him, and his faith will be like a spider’s web
    15: He will lean on his house, and it will not stand; he will prop it up, but it will not rise
    16: He seems to have moisture before the sun arrives; and at sunrise, his sprout shoots forth
    17: His roots will crowd together over a heap of stones, and among the stones he will remain
    18: If someone is devoured right beside him, he will deny him and will say: “I do not know you.
    19: For this is the benefit of his way, that others in turn may spring up from the earth
    20: God will not discard the simple, nor will he extend his hand to the spiteful
    21: even until your mouth is filled with laughter and your lips with rejoicing
    22: Those who hate you, will be clothed with confusion, and the tabernacle of the impious will not continue
