Reading Numbers, chapters ['25', '26', '27', '28']:

  Chapter 25.

    1: Now Israel, at that time, dwelt in Shittim, and the people were fornicating with the daughters of Moab
    2: who called them to their sacrifices. And they ate, and they adored their gods
    3: And Israel was initiated into Baal of Peor. And so the Lord, being angry
    4: said to Moses, “Take all the leaders of the people, and hang them on gallows against the sun, so that my fury may be averted from Israel.
    5: And Moses said to the judges of Israel, “Let each one kill his neighbors, who have been initiated into Baal of Peor.
    6: And behold, one of the sons of Israel entered, in the sight of his brothers, to a prostitute of Midian, within view of Moses and of all the crowd of the sons of Israel, who were weeping before the door of the tabernacle
    7: And when Phinehas the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, had seen it, he rose up from the midst of the multitude, and, seizing a dagger
    8: he entered after the Israelite man, into the brothel, and he pierced both of them at the same time, specifically, the man and the woman at the location of their genitals. And the scourge ceased from among the sons of Israel
    9: And there were slain twenty-four thousand men
    10: And the Lord said to Moses
    11: “Phinehas the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, has averted my wrath from the sons of Israel. For he was moved against them by my zeal, so that I myself, in my zeal, might not wipe away the sons of Israel
    12: Because of this, say to him: Behold, I give to him the peace of my covenant
    13: And the covenant of the everlasting priesthood shall be as much for him as for his offspring. For he was zealous on behalf of his God, and he has made expiation for the wickedness of the sons of Israel.
    14: Now the name of the Israelite man, who was killed with the Midianite woman, was Zimri the son of Salu, a leader from the kinship and tribe of Simeon
    15: Moreover, the Midianite woman, who was put to death together with him, was called Cozbi the daughter of Zur, a most noble leader among the Midianites
    16: And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying
    17: “Let the Midianites perceive you as enemies, and strike them down
    18: for they, too, have behaved with hostility against you, and they have deceived you insidiously by means of the idol Peor, and by Cozbi, the daughter of a commander of Midian, their sister, who was struck down in the day of the scourge because of the sacrilege of Peor.

    3: “Our father died in the desert, and was not with the sedition, which was stirred up against the Lord under Korah, but he died in his own sin; he had no male sons. Why is his name taken away from his family, because he had no son? Give us a possession among the kinsmen of our father.
    4: And Moses referred their case to the judgment of the Lord
    5: And the Lord said to him
    6: “The daughters of Zelophehad are asking for something just. So give them a possession among the kinsmen of their father, and let them succeed him in his inheritance
    7: And to the sons of Israel, you shall speak these things
    8: When a man dies without a son, his inheritance shall be transferred to his daughter
    9: If he has no daughter, his brothers shall succeed him
    10: But if there were also no brothers, you shall give the inheritance to the brothers of his father
    11: But if he has no paternal uncles, the inheritance shall be given to those who are closest to him. And this shall be, for the sons of Israel, consecrated as a perpetual law, just as the Lord has instructed Moses.
    12: The Lord also said to Moses: “Ascend onto this mountain, Abarim, and contemplate from there the land, which I will give to the sons of Israel
    13: And when you have seen it, you shall then go to your people, just as your brother Aaron went
    14: For you offended me in the desert of Sin at the Contradiction of the multitude; neither were you willing to sanctify me in their sight over the waters. These are the Waters of Contradiction at Kadesh in the desert of Sin.
    15: Moses answered him
    16: “May the Lord, the God of the spirits of all flesh, provide a man, who may be over this multitude
    17: and who may be able to exit and enter before them, and who may lead them out or lead them in: lest the people of the Lord be like sheep without a shepherd.
    18: And the Lord said to him: “Take Joshua, the son of Nun, a man in whom the Spirit is, and place your hand upon him
    19: And he shall stand before Eleazar the priest and the entire multitude
    20: And you shall give him the precepts in the sight of all, and a portion of your glory, so that the entire congregation of the sons of Israel may listen to him
    21: On his behalf, if anything is to be done, Eleazar the priest shall consult the Lord. He, and all the sons of Israel with him, and the rest of the multitude, shall go out and enter in at his word.
    22: Moses did just as the Lord had instructed. And when he had brought Joshua, he set him before Eleazar the priest, and before the entire gathering of the people
    23: And imposing his hands upon his head, he repeated all that the Lord had commanded

  Chapter 28.

    1: The Lord also said to Moses
    2: “Instruct the sons of Israel, and you shall say to them: Offer my oblation and bread, and the incense of most sweet odor, at their proper times
    3: These are the sacrifices which you must offer: Two immaculate one-year-old lambs each day as a perpetual holocaust
    4: You shall offer one in morning, and the other in the evening
    5: and the tenth part of an ephah of fine wheat flour, which has been sprinkled with the purest oil, and which has the measure of the fourth part of a hin
    6: It is the continual holocaust which you offered at mount Sinai as a most sweet odor of incense to the Lord
    7: And you shall offer a libation of wine, of the fourth part of a hin for each lamb, in the Sanctuary of the Lord
    8: And you shall offer the other lamb similarly, in the evening, according to all the rites of the morning sacrifice and its libations, as an oblation of most sweet odor to the Lord
    9: Then, on the Sabbath day, you shall offer two immaculate one-year-old lambs, and two tenths of fine wheat flour sprinkled with oil, as sacrifice, as well as the libation
    10: that are usually poured out on each Sabbath as a perpetual holocaust
    11: Then, on the first day of the month, you shall offer a holocaust to the Lord: two calves from the herd, one ram, seven immaculate one-year-old lambs
    12: and three tenths of fine wheat flour sprinkled with oil, as sacrifice, for each calf, and two tenths of fine wheat flour sprinkled with oil, for each ram
    13: and one tenth of fine wheat flour with oil, as a sacrifice, for each lamb. It is a holocaust of most sweet odor and also an incense to the Lord
    14: Now these shall be the libations of wine, which are to be poured out for each victim: one half portion of a hin for each calf, one third for a ram, and one fourth for a lamb. This shall be the holocaust for all the months, as they succeed one another in the turning of the year
    15: Likewise, a he-goat shall be offered to the Lord for sin, with the perpetual holocaust and its libations
    16: Then, in the first month, the fourteenth day of the month shall be the Passover of the Lord
    17: And the fifteenth day shall be a solemnity. For seven days, they shall eat unleavened bread
    18: And the first day of these days shall be venerable and holy; you shall not do any servile work in it
    19: And you shall offer the incense of a holocaust to the Lord, two calves from the herd, one ram, seven immaculate one-year-old lambs
    20: and with each sacrifice, from fine wheat flour which has been sprinkled with oil, three tenths for each calf, and two tenths for each ram
    21: and one tenth for each lamb, that is, for the seven lambs
    22: and one he-goat for sin, as an expiation for you
    23: aside from the morning holocaust, which you shall always offer
    24: You shall do this on each day of the seven days, as fuel for the fire, and as a most sweet odor to the Lord, which shall rise up from the holocaust and from each of the libations
    25: Likewise, the seventh day shall be very honored and holy for you. Any servile work, you shall not do in it
    26: And also the day of the first-fruits, after the weeks have been fulfilled, when you shall offer new fruits to the Lord, shall be venerable and holy. You shall not do any servile work in it
    27: And you shall offer a holocaust as a most sweet odor to the Lord: two calves from the herd, one ram, and seven immaculate one-year-old lambs
    28: and also, as their sacrifices, fine wheat flour sprinkled with oil, three tenths for each calf, two for each ram
    29: one tenth for each lamb, which all together are seven lambs; likewise, a he-goat
    30: which is slain for expiation, aside from the perpetual holocaust and its libations
    31: You shall offer only what is immaculate, with their libations.
